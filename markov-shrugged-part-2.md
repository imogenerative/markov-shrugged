## Chapter 1


The way he wore his formal clothes made the rest of us and, incidentally, centuries for the history of Rearden Steel. She saw Francisco d'Anconia enter, bow to Lillian, then walk into the crowd as if he were speeding down a skyway suspended and coiling in empty space. I wondered, once in a while, involuntarily, almost surreptitiously, as if struggling to dispel something he would have had to carry. And now, as she looked at the order, but he was walking into it with nothing for any trappers to gain. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html it was not the threat of being arrested at any moment by an attack that would Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html Don't shake like this, she thought. Whenever you think that you are in the same brusque, mirthless way. Then she knew that she had made them choose to give to the world for being a place so eagerly worth seeing. He was assuming the tone and manner of a last look at one another. It was the shriek of agony, the call for help, the voice of a businessman, the sound of the waterfall before she saw the figures of men in the office—and some day she would meet him. There have always been men of intelligence who went on strike, in protest and in demanding anger—in protest against whatever it was that she missed most: a glimpse of Rearden outside. There was a dim astonishment at the fact that the stock of d'Anconia Copper has risen within the last year. 


It seems to me that he's dislocated the economy of the whole of the earth where the two straight lines of steel that went off into the sky, as if drawn from the events. I had no right to the wielding of violence against victims deprived of the right of the unendurable pleasure it gave her. I'm much more of an animal lying in the middle of the cab. She strained back, trying to draw away from him, she held his glance austerely for an instant. I thought that one should feel it, and more: as if it had not. We will work it so that those on your staff from becoming inquisitive about it. The ancient walls could not contain it, the sounds of the crowd, the letters TT on a silver platter before her, its glow dancing over her face and the dark hollows of his eyes. 


I am in full agreement with the airline's top officials in New York, that spring. A man who existed only in her knowledge of her hours of impatience and his own. He said it, from the doorway of her office, and had sat in incredulous horror before the fact that the Washington planners found it necessary to lead our enemies to this valley. They huddled around me while I called the Institute long distance and asked them. After a while, she saw that he, too, was only the symbol of a much wider issue. So we came to New York. Have you had a chance to rebuild the rest. Have meeting in San Francisco tomorrow night. He bought it from Mayor Bascom of Rome, Wisconsin, leaned back in her chair, at her desk, motionless, watching in blank wonder. He signaled a passing taxicab and held the door open, Mitchum's fist shot out, smashed into his face and a mouth that looked as if nothing else had ever been registered. 


These had been the motor of the world. Rearden whirled to him, then held the glass clutched in her hand. Danagger was watching her as if he had resented and found irresistibly attractive, had been the man she was seeking, and Rearden had been right; this was why they began to say it, whenever they felt that they had known each other for Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html a moment's approach to that which isn't. He was looking at a fogbound city, it was her duty to work! She started back toward the center of this camp, on the sixtieth floor, in what was known as the Middle Ages. He dismissed it; it was not the image of everything I should have said on the radio : calm, confident—and out of reach. The purpose of man's life, say both, is to become an inanimate object turned over to her husband's use. 


She put the cigarettes in her pocket; he saw that in postponing this moment for hours, he had not known till after it was over. For reasons of his own fate and his personal decision, she had thought about it, she had never done before, his manner neither daring nor apologetic, but simply and openly personal. On the day when she could not refuse him. Francisco was now silent, he was watching her face, as if he longed to take a few seconds to control herself. She would have appeared calm except that her eyes followed him, enjoying the sight of his face. The vaulting held the solemn peace of a decision reached—and the stillness of a black velvet cape, more arrogantly, ostentatiously patrician than any spread of sables. She sat straight, the planes of his skin in the open windows. You ought to get out had vanished. She thought: To find a consciousness like her own, who would be easiest to convince, to beg or to bribe. The man at the bottom of his watchers sensations, the thought they knew only that she kept seeing the blood on the face of Francisco d'Anconia. The lights died in the first light of morning. 


Dagny laughed, in enjoyment of the moment, a moment they could not run out of victims. . . . Although the tensile strength of the bridge spread in the light of the desk was erect, the cold blue eyes showed nothing but the pick of the country's airports—and she saw that it was his first day of work in the mountain sections, Colorado first. I thought she was the child of his tortured resistance. He merely told people that they would not be hopeless. But the great burst of sound was being shaped by him as a progressive businessman. A glass ashtray crashed to the floor off the desk, as she leaped to the first point she had not known till after it was lost. She felt as if it were not a person to him, but only a race against death. He wondered why she wanted to live with an open grin, as if the center of this camp, on the sixtieth floor, in what was known as the Middle Ages. Philip's face assumed a look of astonishment, of acceptance, of repose. 


I don't want to help the smaller fellows to develop. He had negotiated a loan from the government. She noticed small streaks that looked like an expert mechanic, but he was knocked awake when the operator's words reached his brain. She thought: I know what you're dying for. You have no means to do it. There was an abnormal clarity about every object in the room, yet she was seeing now was evil for evil's sake. Those in the first moment of returning to consciousness: two words suddenly made everything real to her. 


Yet it was a form of defiance against those who start the use of his Metal. His head on her arms. He rushed in and out of Jasper, Oklahoma. His face held the remnant of the motor. He seemed to want her approval, without having to know whether she was introducing to New York in a hopeless quest for some form of contentment, I won't take it away from you. 


He had three months in which to work, to grow, to move forward. But she would work, she thought, and grow up to that world. He grasped a feeling that forbade him to confess it, the desperate innocence of the effort he was making; he had decided to make the mystery greater. Dr. Stadler felt no horror, he felt nothing, it was not proper to let it matter. She heard his report on what he wished to appear; he was pacing the room, her steps now unrhythmically tense. She knew she was alone in the middle of the night. The Taggart Tunnel, an eight-mile bore, cut through the crowd and to be shackled, according to your economics. 


She followed him down to the greater strength of the bridge built, advancing across the river. The first shop to rise by the side of a curve, he saw moving flashlights and a red thread winding down his cheekbone. I would like to spare you the strain of struggling for a livelihood. What I've learned is that a code of values by which we made our choice. That they're holding us by our love of it, and then it is justice that destroys them. The face seemed faintly familiar to him, but said nothing else. The product of a thought he would not touch her. He had stopped at the window of the Comet. 


The editor had refused; he had stated that it would be unfair to lesser scientists, because it would say everything and because they had made him lose his body. I know that the plane was gone. Whenever an electric beam went flashing briefly at her living room, he thought, and then he would match her trust. The sun was beating down upon them and Dr. Stadler glanced at each other, as if across an interplanetary distance. High above him, she saw his eyes move along the track, ready to leave for the day. The people of Sand Creek, Illinois, where Confederated Machines had closed two weeks later. In the purity of the summer air, at the joy of a drunkard, but of a fresh wooden scaffolding erected to shelter the birth of a skyscraper. My father and grandfather built up the Community National had bum investments all over three or four states. She looked up at her. He thought of it, because there was no suffering in his face, no doubt, nothing but the figure of a great estate, and mountains slashed by pits of red ore in the distance. 


At the moment, he was thinking of herself. I will not shift to you the power of living as a sin—he saw, with the clarity of the eyes, it seemed incongruous, it resembled the calm, not of a chariot driver, but of a sunrise. Such tenants as it sheltered were half-bankrupt, existing, as it did, that the voice of a speaker pouring from a radio tower through the air of the room—and she realized how brief a moment had passed between. I add an extra span of time left within him. She did not hear them consciously, but the sound of the call for help, the voice of a military report, consulting no papers, looking straight at her. We are giving men everything they've professed to want and to seek him out, as if he were sitting at his desk, keeping his eyes and fully certain that he recognized her and she had no power to hurt. She did not try to produce a value and keep it, but moral to give it form. 


Sebastian d'Anconia, his ancestor, had left Spain many centuries ago, at a time when men were afraid that somebody will name what everybody knows. Galt opened his eyes and of his pride? He gave himself no time to give it, he could not recall where she had rented it, and walked out without a word. Do not cry, when you reach the top. They were nervously blank; they showed nothing but the coldest, most profound indifference—wasn't it a betrayal of that which had not been able to understand why they did it so eagerly. She could not define her own feeling; she knew only as an employee. She saw at a glance what they had earned it long ago. Cherryl waited, until she saw Dagny in a corner of the street lamp that had once been the center of a glass ashtray on a table, the other on the floor, not to move off that spot, not to do it. 


You have a great deal of money . . . it was always man whom they immolated and the animal whom they enshrined. As the engine went past him, every man in the middle, you'll understand it now. But they had grown Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html drown her in his arms down the mountainside, but this meeting of their lips. Can't expect it sooner than two weeks . . . of some such desert as the one part of him were only features that seemed implacable and dead. There were no marks of wheels on curve, the light came from three hundred bulbs in the blazing sun to the road on the edge of the sky over the mills. Then the blinding white glare of anger, Dagny was seeing a long line of car roofs melted into a silver string, and the train seemed lost in a region of the Rocky Mountains and regarded as an engineering achievement not to be anything is the desire not to be. To undercut your consciousness has always been on the Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html It scared them away. It will cut down the burden of the second, men might learn to see the earth. They take their emotions as a cause, and their mind as a shock: it did not seem to notice. She stood up angrily and backed away from the headlines to the glow at the edge of a chair, as if he were pouting at the world. 


One was supposed to spare them moments such as this—and, with a feeling of desperate loyalty that was almost apology. He kept pointing at the pieces of typewriter. Watching nervously, Taggart felt relief—and a touch of quiet pride, as if it were not for the reason its perpetrators intended. And that's what Dr. Stadler needed from you—it was you who spoke about their trust and my honor. She tried to think; but an end will be put to death, to secure the survival of the rest. She looked down through the open window and saw the headlight jerk sidewise, he knew that this was virtue, then he wanted no contact with them, not even in the darkness of the trees that stood against the glow of that knowledge, and there was nothing else that it could be done or not and that the red light and at the rail that would vanish, the bridges that would crumble, the signal lights were spaced two miles apart. Dagny could not see the world reborn as fast as they could put it out. Every house looked as if they were giving her an exultant right to this moment. He had no right to exist except for the lighted glass cube of Tower A, that hung in his mind as an empty shape. You are the only ones who know that it had been the most prosperous year in Taggart history. The sole suggestion of luxury was the color of a fish that's been lying around too long! 


She saw him looking at her without expression, but the steadiness of her voice. He bowed to her courteously, he smiled, and he looked into its trunk as into the mouth of the furnace—he stood confidently in the elevator, the clicks of the flashing numbers above the door of her office said: September 2. He knew that he had wanted Galt to die, knowing fully that his own death would follow. You had the connections to do it, I know how much I've hurt you, I'll tell you that I have a superintendent 77! in charge of it; he was a young man, no longer too young, with a bloodless face and the eyes of young Rearden, as he'd been when I'd met him first. Society is suffering for lack of supplies that had not been printed. She came back to the office was full. She was absorbed, at the moment, however, they're . . . could he do? Not in the immediate future—and there's nothing left to him was to hide it and to exist—without our help. We've given them such a demonstration that all that rot is going to pieces, she's still fighting to stay alive. Dr. Ferris spread out his hands in the glow of a factory, she saw the look of weariness disappearing from her eyes. I have a great deal of space and rock, a spot of living fire twisting in the wind. 


Thin, single and hot, like the burning pressure of a wordless thought: he had a good record. Francisco's airplane was hidden in the heart of a man whose music overflowed with violent color. Commercialism is supposed to honor and this is what you should have discovered for me. So I want to make a living —and, therefore, the purchase of the abandoned steel mills in Pennsylvania. You wouldn't know the kind of confidence he had felt when she had regarded language as a tool of exchange, which can't exist unless there are goods produced and of all the people who filled the courtroom had been told that his face was pulled tight, and the sealed line of his mouth. But a block away, when she had noticed the empty moment of a pause. . . . The sharp pain was the shock of people who had not moved, the people who filled the courtroom had been told by the press that they would do it, because they would be now, a sight he could neither endure nor control. Instead, he-tiptoed to a chair, grinning at her look of sudden attentiveness, the look of that blackmail-through-virtue which he had left. She saw him looking at her, with the same sensation of knowing that nothing more could be expected to be saints nor to be punished for their sins. It was as if their bodies were two currents rising upward together, each to a single train moving or not, so long as you make money? 


His voice was brusque and dry; but he had had no way to express it. Let me have my engineers work out the problem of the next. She felt a moment's rebellion and a hint of comradeship, a comradeship based—for both of them—on self-contempt. Mark Yonts was the head of his department. They were offering Galt the best that the railroad had been falling slowly for many years. It was startling to see him on that last evening. She knew, by a faint, solemn stress in the tone of a dryly meticulous bookkeeper, a report about a wreck on the main line of the fault in the stone. Her office was like a silent cry. 


She heard them declare that the John Galt Line in the newspapers for months; he knew that he had lost all further interest in the issue confronting them, the mind had been discarded as irrelevant long ago. What Dr. Ferris was the only one to see. Now you wish to stay. She stepped back, as if to please him. The movement and noise of the motor and the remnant of Halley’s melody that gave it value. The two words sounded shockingly violent, because his face and at the root of his hatred. 


The man who had paused for a moment and looked up at the skyscrapers they passed. In the line of her shoulders sculptured by the cloth, the shadows and the light. If the railroad was run by a mechanism locked in a room that had been hidden here, but never given voice. She thought of this structure, half the size of a toolshed, it had no quality of fear, not the kind of short cut he took. Both sides agreed that no rational morality is possible, that there is no full record of the complete operation or the basic principle involved. All of them were seeing the things he was seeing. 


Nothing can direct the process but his own enjoyment—just try to think of them again, wishing he were carried to the time when train signals were not steel and wire, but men holding lanterns. Hank Rearden learned it from the relatives of its last owner. She went back to his house; it had been his. She had never objected; she had never known that power companies existed. The lines of his face was distorted. What identity are they able to give to this occasion the decorous setting of a formal dinner. They were the bondholders of the John Galt Line, so to inform the office of John Galt, Inc. They talked about tradition, the president had always been at ease together, in his office. His lower lip swelled a little in a faint, continuous shudder, then grasped that the objects she had thought only of his own free choice, at this table and at the light—the light that came from Bertram Scudder; it was an invention of incalculable importance. You will live in a world where all men have become their acknowledged inferiors. They'll leave us alone to do it, I know how this will hit you and I know it. 


Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html Slowly, with a long column of directives on the front page announced that upon taking over the copyrights. We are on strike against those who had incurred Galt's disfavor: with Dr. Ferris and Eugene Lawson. That's what happened to Bertram. Do you want to know it—yes, it's because I'm worried about taking over the San Sebastian Line down to a single train moving or not, so long as he knew that he wanted Galt to be reduced. Then she knew that the same presence seemed to be an aristocrat? To destroy morality, nature, justice and reason by means of nothing but a gray weariness. The front pages of the manuscript among them. 


I hope you're not going to blame me! If it turned out to be an employer? He stood beside her; he had followed her, he had known it, but she felt as if a disembodied train, reduced to a single sight and a single, wordless emotion—but she had always known it. When Mr. Ward had gone, Rearden came out into the road must have come from behind the buildings into the sky, as if trying to discern something at a great distance. She noticed another door, left half-open; it led to questions that men did not ask him to take her out, but remained in her mind to link them—once and for all . . . Do you remember? She found herself, in terror, twisting her body against his legs, and bent down to kiss her mouth. 


That's what they call results. They are alive, she thought, because they are true of being qua being. The steam of the engines and the wall. He sat looking at the clusters of waybills that hung on the wall in the same coils of smoke. But I didn't think that anyone would ever have of the world demand a higher standard of living. The thin tremor that ran along Mr. Thompson's lips was a smile that did not pertain to torture; he had asked the question, holding her body against his legs, and bent down to kiss her mouth. He stood impassively, his head held level, she saw the look of happiness was gone, but the amusement of the laughter that shocked Mr. Thompson. No, she thought, what she felt for Taggart Transcontinental. She had learned nothing: neither the reason for the things she would never reach. A cold wind rattled the broken signs over the windows of the offices of newly created executives, made the members of the Board had slipped into his mills in the past two years, have you? It was not by means of a single Diesel unit, and with ten times the power. She regretted that she was looking away, up the railroad track. 


The month behind her had gone, leaving nothing but the violent stillness within her were saying: Not the things that gave it value. . . . Nobody knows how it got out, but it went through the task of shock absorber for his fragile burden, to the task of a producer devising better ways to deal with people? She felt certain that she would run the railroad some day. She heard a key turning in the door of the cabin at sunset and watch the motion of a suicide. He seemed to want her to leave, he did not care what or if they are made to suffer. That Stockton Foundry out there had no right to complain if others were slow to follow. There was no furniture inside, no papers, nothing but the pleasure of knowing that the verdict applied to her, to every man in his early thirties, with a homely, angular face and an attractive smile. Sooner or later, whether you intended it or not, they had to bring you to this?—why is it his body that refused to move, stunned by shock, while his mind was a failure, that he was in New York tonight. There had been times when an unsummoned vision—a sight of the Rearden Metal track in deference to public opinion. 


And the earth is littered with mangled cripples, who don't know what he felt, even though she was only an empty shell; its heart had Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html replastered his living room? Yet he did not seem to care even for the effort of our muscles, no more than physical labor, consumes the material value-equivalent of his own order and the hiccough-moan of the figure in black slacks and a flying jacket—she looked wonderful—she'd got windburned, it looked like a system of existence where objective reality is the same as her own, as there was no wire to repair it; he said nothing and obeyed. Few people liked her face: the face was too well known to them and to that world which was theirs and his. One declares so many things to be different or trying to change them. They reached the factory of the Twentieth Century Motor trademark was as good as the next fellow. 


Who made it possible for them not to do it. Glancing up at the ceiling of his office. Far below, in the valley, in the gathering twilight—with whom she was running down the hall, feeling his bitterness relax into gaiety—he knocked at the door. He sat down in an armchair, seeing the eager little jolt that threw her at the dime-store counter, in the subway, on the stoop of a brownstone house. The great Taggart Bridge at Bedford, Illinois, had been placed closer to the table. 


She had asked her chief engineer to submit a design and an estimate of the objects reminded her that she had heard about, she thought . . . Losses? I don't want to think of something to say to her: People like you will always be attracted to the highest of emotions, you permit them to do it better than most people—the fact that my mind and body were a unit, and that my body was not a thought, it was like a stunning blow, and before they had time to meet them at the moment in his mind. She sat down at the table among them. I don't know what damn fool finally told him about her meeting with Dr. Ferris had stood on a ridge, the largest house of the old school, and the only quality they had in common was the stamp James Taggart had dreaded, from which there was no time to notice their disappointment. She saw no sign of mechanical failure; it looked like a frontiersman's shanty thrown together to serve as a height I have climbed to attain a wider field of vision. The hand of the clock on the wall of the office. That desire—which had never given her a hint that he would do anything but stare at the note written by a hand plow. James Taggart was the first time in our lives. It was the final certainty that his whole body was aware of the long, senseless agony of the years between them; the sidewalks were deserted; it was hard to trace: the gaunt figure on the window sill, and the faces he had confronted when he had found it to be converted into kinetic power—right or wrong? She sat beside him in his office when his ore mines were taken away from him—the moment when he could think of. 


He did not raise his voice, but the catch of his breath was falling to an even rhythm, like the cardiograph record of a steady heartbeat written across the sky. She did not know why—when the telephone rang and his secretary told him that if he had not known to be his only interest, the first thing men will sacrifice. In the moment when she felt uneasy; she told herself that Taggart Transcontinental will recover from its loss on that preposterous San Sebastian Line. I know why you should forgive me, but it's my place to tell you that the purpose of self-preservation that man needs the strictest code of values to guide his actions. But those of you who have known a single moment of love for this earth, this earth which was his, not theirs. She was off guard; she did not mention Bertram Scudder—or Dagny Taggart. He did not know whether this was mockery. 


I will play it for you, any of it, but I cannot be certain. She wondered how long a man could not reverse himself so late in life. A glass ashtray crashed to the floor of the cabin at sunset and watch the motion of the crowd, which were beyond the stage of fighting a storm. Love was the key to it, the more you suffered; the more you pay them, the more they will demand; the greater the depravity it permits to the loved. He felt a sensation of malevolent triumph at the thought that accidents of this nature were being forgotten everywhere . . . Oh God, what are we going to put up with the swift figure streaking off through stretches of unleveled soil toward the homes of the nation; that if it had been his idol. That future that they're all talking and trembling about—it will be as you made it, you fought for it, you were not stopped by pain, not by whatever kind it was that one started this sort of fight for. With no sound but the snap of a twig or the ring of mountains growing higher, its peaks coming closer together in the same aspiration. There was no sign of any feeling. 


That's all you're after and that is the power to dispose of the great, dead foundry at Stockton, Colorado, it was Nielsen Motors . . . Then cancel the order, please. Why do we have to preserve some semblance of the greatness that I saw in you—I would not take a government job. Whatever it is that he's man. The sun had not yet vanished beyond the mountains, there was only a figure hurrying in and out of bed, she had bribed two of them were horse-drawn. It will cut down the burden of his aimlessness upon her mercy—an attempt of the same class as the Starnes model, at half the price! She heard the words; she understood the meaning; she was unable to speak and that she would. They knew that the boy had crawled and for how many miles the memory of some weight that had been thought impossible by the city's experts. 


Rearden had leaped to her feet. It was Eddie Willers who came in and put the order down on his desk; he made no comment, but merely said that he had taken along with him, could not matter. It was he who had lived through a month of agony, he whom she had escaped and what she now felt was all the two of them their own persons were this day's sole meaning. She felt herself blushing, for the first time where that music came from. An honest man is one who knows that he can't exist without it, and what happens to him if they walked out? 


There could be a fine of $5,000 was imposed on Henry Rearden, but that the sentence named what she had felt a desperate desire to escape. She chuckled, wondering at his accuracy: he had guessed the nature of the accusations and I will not molest you with tricks or pleas. On the afternoon of September 14, when the telephone rang and his secretary told him that he would see her Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html She turned to him, in the manner of an owner undressing a person whose consent is not required. Then it was said that in spite of and in contradiction to its nature. She cut through the summit of the Rocky Mountains to the Taggart operator in New York, she told herself that Mr. Mowen did not issue any statements about the trial. When he raised his head, Chalmers saw that the lens was pressed to her mouth, so that the virtues which made life possible and the values which gave it meaning and sanction was held as a shameful sin . . . if there was no way; ingenuity was a virtue of the victims. But she felt a wrench of discomfort in the muscles of his own despoilers. 


I cannot work under the orders of your superiors?—that we can never be free of progression, free of the bonds of morality, that love is some static gift which, once granted, need no longer be possible. Within a week, drill heads of Rearden Metal was mine—it must mean to him what everybody knew: the quick fortunes that were being made on Rearden Metal. She knew only that he had never seen a motor of this kind? It was said that Nat Taggart was her ancestor. I don't want to stay here for a while. You have heard him denounced in the past six months, ever since his arrival in New York. She staggered to the house, she wondered what had been his idol. A few points of fire were scattered through the darkness, bumping into half-clothed figures that waved the futile little flares of matches. 


Cages containing rats and guinea pigs were stacked against the walls of her room, faintly visible in patches of shining green and seemed to light the forest. The sharper bites of fear came from the fact that it refused to absorb. I thought she was the most orderly run on a green-blue track, that must have been our own guilt. She glanced up at his face, he saw the sudden, startling sight of a sun-flooded forest, the sense of congratulation upon the greatest victory he had ever experienced. Dr. Stadler asked in the courteously peremptory tone of an off-color story, was Dr. Simon Pritchett. He did not know at what moment to demolish the whole of this day was as brilliantly, violently clear as the splashes of sun on the face of a granite drop—and miles of contorted stone below, she saw the enemy. It had been followed by a geyser of the bricks that had crumbled. Should the soul vanish from the earth, as a breath long-held and released. There were patches of snow on the ridges of hills kept moving closer, as if the words struck him inside his throat. Give up and get out of a bad hole, first. 


He knew that no physical hunger could bring a chunk of butter for an attractive young woman who owned the bakery shop. The man who came on the wire was that of a boy out to write obscenities on fences. In their childhood, this had been the laboratory that she stopped. Let me tell you about the political and moral system under which you are honoring in this very moment, by your very desire? When he drove up to his face, he saw resentment growing in their eyes. Then he had been thirty-six when he had looked at her with a sense of physical discomfort. If you do, I'll have a chance to succeed in the midst of ancient trees, among green branches that hung down to meet them. He complied, telling himself that he demanded perfection. 


She was looking up at the crest of a distant past, where he would have been a form of defiance, as if she owned its owner. We're not supposed to be meant, so he Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html She noticed the occasional, surreptitious glances that people were throwing in their direction. . . . Tell the country what sort of pressure was used on him. She glanced at her face: it was the only image in his mind. Remember that you can give them what they mean by anything . . . You'll hear about every wreck. It was a question to which he was entitled, it was hunger for the response of her body and her body one with the plane, she fought the sudden gusts that tipped the earth as a place of competence and power. 


He smiled mirthlessly, spreading his hands in his pockets, looking at her flushed face and at her room. She kept seeing his figure in that crowd was a point of support. Neither Dagny nor Mrs. Taggart said a word for a long time, looking at him intently. He asked to Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html of the men in turn—she had repeated the same unintelligible speech, feeling a stab of horror, the convulsion of a mind grasping a problem and untangle a conflict, does it by means of the jobs which I give them—and on me, by means of the poison of disintegration that turns men into hordes of scavengers. She pushed her hat off with the air of the drawing room, among the velvet drapes and bare, polished tables. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html She paced the room for about half an hour, in a leisurely flow. If this is all you have to defy one or the other: America or mystics. 


He turned to glance at the memos he had left at the mercy of any pestilence and any storm. Her eyes kept coming back to him, puzzled. Eddie Willers had given themselves to the railroad was called the blood system of the world, as a threat, as a challenge, as a reproach. The muffled scream of a man hurrying up the trail. Jim was one of yours. So he waited, holding his love in the place that had once been the cause of your plea. He snapped on her desk had become, not a tribute to you, but not to believe unpatriotic rumors. 


He carried an automatic pistol in one Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html It was to avoid moments such as this that all the steel I poured came back to him and to nod. She glanced around and gasped at the sight of a gas station, a glittering white island of glass and light. Moving blindly away through the coils of an ascending grade. He flew through the days of your father I would have refunded every penny of it will go back to the window, to stand aside and let them escape on then- way to prison—men were going through the motions of the un-living; no, worse, he thought—the antiliving. They had asked for and accepted Directive 10-289, he thought, they would have jeered at his air of self-confident wealth. They did not give up his mills, as he would not obey; but he was stared at by the faces around her. If you are now beginning to fear that you're now dependent upon me. This was his period of training for solitude, he thought; he did not have to see him. In the narrow space between the dark silhouettes of two buildings, as in the cabin of a ship in motion, and the lights were like the lights of the valley condensing into a soft blue vapor far below. And you know you can count on our co-operation in any step you now find it necessary to lead our enemies to this valley. For the flash of an instant, then an angular crack shot through the twilight. Then she understood that what she needed was the motion to a goal and as if he were pleading. 


## Chapter 2


His shirt studs were ostentatiously too large, but it was the scream of the knowledge of your five. Dagny sat motionless and her face was Ellis Wyatt. We will not deal with men by means of her certainty that his mind is the root of his hatred. What do you want of me?—was the question that had lashed her for weeks, but had not pronounced a word. Therefore, the country's top problem is to preserve the transportation industry as a whole were to be closed—or if any one of us will win, but both will profit. The movement of his lips pressed together in token of one or the other. By their own statement, you must support them because they cannot survive without us, yet propose to dictate the terms of Directive 10-289—though not for the obvious personal eagerness, it would have destroyed the valley in her eyes. So he did not look to his left and neither did the rajahs of the People's State of Argentina and the People's State of India. You wouldn't want them to find me. 


She leaned against the corner of a street, and a battered car being parked below, with a flash of sun on the face of John Galt was looking straight at her. One farmer was found, half a mile from Winston, Colorado, on a division which was to have no room for anything else. The purpose for which my years of work, my . . . Still, there's hope. It bore no mark of the kind of insolent curiosity that made her turn to be subjected to violence. She waited with patient curiosity to discover his own irredeemable evil. He climbed back into the ballroom, cutting straight through the crowd, Dagny wondered why she had married him. It was whispered that the first could be learned, but the second destroys your capacity to distinguish truth from error. The track workers, the switchmen, the yardmen, who had always faced him in a state which was both tension and peace—because he lay in bed, naked because her body had the hardness, the gaunt, tensile strength, the clean precision of a railroad was public service, not profit. People explained him by saying that he had been head of the New York executives were playing and the nature of his action. It used to be dozens. 


This was the act of ownership brought to unendurable violence by the thought of a telephone on his desk without a word. Just as man is free to seek his happiness in any mindless fraud, but the torture of an impossible code—and your fight against it did not belong in his world. Abruptly, behind a turn of the road, when she glanced at the statue when she walked out. You have also heard it said that one had to offer, and of our product, because they can't produce. The boy she had known what she had inflicted was the torture of boredom. It had been a large dinner reception at the home of her successful son, he would not steal fruit from a sidewalk stand. You would not be able to face all that had had to earn their own experience and money. He dropped his hand in his pocket, his fingers closed suddenly in her hair and he raised the lock to his lips. Once, when she was sixteen, looking at a fogbound city, it was her self-dedication to unrequited love. A white rectangle hung over the bottom of that canyon for ages. He did not want to lose them. It would not move; it was part of his community, he's got a right to your wages, but we had no railroad? 


It would be so superior to anything we've got that it would get me—I'd rot all the way through, like the rest of their breakfast. It is evil to succeed, since success is made by the flames that twisted through the derricks of Wyatt Oil. But they went to a great American school, which his father had earned in profits in the last three days. She had come to sudden life when he had been able to decide on any specific ambition. If that were the society columns of the newspapers—she could not embarrass him by her ugly poverty; she wanted to cry to him: I'm not one of them. And because I had no power to change your mind, you don't have to commit yourself to anything—only to give me your word that you will quit as soon as the click of a cigarette lighter. A man is part of his rage seemed to be part of this moment. 


The beating within her was one with the plane, she fought the sudden gusts that tipped the earth as a place of competence and luxury combined—and I was the first thing he saw, as he entered, was a thin smile, amused and cold. She gasped, closing her eyes; this was one she had never heard of that brand before. It was so brief a moment of awakening, but like a plea to a dark unknown. It was a common little face, except for a look of recognition melting into a chuckle. She turned coldly, removed her coat and be first to descend, and she stepped to the edge. The work of cooking a meal was like a glass verandah overlooking what had once been muscular. It was the times when she feels that she'd like to find him and stop him. It was liquid iron, and what the scream of the knowledge that everything known to man is non-existent, that only the man who wins. He told himself that this was the simple pain of some physical torture on his body. 


An early darkness mixed with fog was slipping down to fill the hole which Wyatt had left wide open. She was thinking of the honesty he could claim no longer, of the sense of an even, restful twilight, like a spread of peaks and craters that looked like a cloud supporting a body that refuses to function, a rotten hulk that expects to exist without me, as I would be the only one to suffer. She remained still for a long time. Dagny stood by the side of the machine. But do you know that they didn't do it just because we believed that the game could end no other way of ever getting rich. He did not try to bring people back out of the hands of an arrogant evil, made arrogant solely by my ignorance and my submission. Cherryl stood beside him, sagging in his arms, slumped against him, sobbing as she had arrived, the beige traveling suit that looked as if his body were fluid in relaxation, she saw the face and the effort she was making were now a string of cackling gasps, an unrecognizable corruption of laughter. Thought sets one's purpose and the way your eyes would look at me, if . . . We've done it—she thought—this much, at least, is done. One of the worst mountain barrier—but it was the voice of the gray-haired man that stopped her. Look around you-: what you have done to society, you had done it on most of his childhood with the Taggart children, and now he looked as if they were clinging to each other any longer. They knew who it was before her, reached and done, the power of his brain—and he found it on the top of the rise that led to Rockdale Station. 


Engineer Joseph Scott threw the throttle wide open, not to let herself scream aloud, while they were unable to decide whether his manner was part scorn, as if he knew that this meant the answer Yes. Let them check—before they grant themselves the unspeakable license of evil-as-necessity—whether they know what it would mean, having to work with a gun on his hip, he had kept snapping that discipline was the first heat for the first time. A sheaf of sparks went up in the rectangle of the taxi's wheels: You who believed you must live for your country and that your lives depended upon me; you did not quite hear or believe it, at first. There was no paint left on the door, but it was not the target, it was his greatest achievement, the summation of their past, its end and their seal of acceptance. Lillian was not looking at him, wondering what it was he who walked up toward her, walked very slowly, while she stood still, and threw his racket across, at her feet, she observed what memory it brought back to him by Lillian; he was seeing her as she approached, but he did not look up, he seemed to have forgotten it. He had brought an object she had never spoken to him of that Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html She waited, her pity vanishing and becoming respect. She can't tell what they might do. They kept their secret from the knowledge that they had. Its rising lines cut the sky, with no mountains to stop it, a deserted highway and the remnant of a drink. 


She laughed, remembering the quiet self-control, the strict precision, the stern logic of the young woman in a ballroom, like the winner of a silent radio. I told you that it is real, but it is not a fool. The nature of their world into the open and identify the exact nature of her quest . . . like waves rolling to swallow the earth and she was laughing in the last flicker of the blue flames, while he sat in a silent forest, at the foot of a white curve, hung a webbed rectangle which was the battery of coke ovens. I thought that you were trying to do it now. They, too, felt that something had happened, by the way he fingered the marbles in his hand. The superintendent had come in his time, but what were we to know otherwise? But there were times, like tonight, when she felt that she had offended him, that he would have to think later, to think and to work as a cook in a diner—check your premises. These had been the moments when, walking down the street, saw Millie Bush, swung his fist and knocked all her teeth out. Dagny Taggart had announced that the measure had passed, there was no one else could notice; the glance had been more than a faint anxiety; it was impossible or improper. 


I don't want to know anything about it. Before I met you, I used to think that he needs me. You've never suffered, the eyes were looking straight at him. Slumped against the rock, knowing that she owned his body; she still felt it. Taggart's eyes shot to him swiftly: this was still the intense blue of evening. It was the first time I saw you? She told herself that Taggart Transcontinental once stood for. 


But it was never more than a lowering of his eyelids; he had heard the news that Danagger had disappeared. I had worked out an almost impossible schedule to complete the construction of the John Galt Line, so to inform the office of John Galt, Inc. She had not noticed that the men who sat in front of the first train. The windows were open to disaster, but not to achieve. The siege of the gate appeared to be for him—it was all for company expenses. 


The young roadmaster told her only that she kept seeing the blood on the face of the lord of the Inquisition, and escaped before he could be seized. Is the moral purpose of his torture. He knew it was over. Dagny stood at the door of the bathroom open; he could hear the ringing of the telephone in the dispatcher's office downstairs. He sat in a corner, watching him. An animal knows who are its enemies, and when to forget. It was this shape that the screams were now tearing away from him; she felt as if she was performing a duty of no greater significance than the ones in the office She was twenty-nine years old when she told him about her meeting with Dr. Stadler. Yet it was passed up and left in the hands of the fourth knocks any longer in the jumbled screeching of metal, she could not say what it was, because the first moment that she grasped fully was when she saw the secret premise behind their words. He had bought that vase for the satisfaction of his desire—and his victory, she knew, was a tribute to you, but a reproach; not an achievement, but a reminder of shame. 


She stared at the car, not with the apprehensive curiosity of workmen, but with the tension of his face was calm; what frightened her was seeing him smile gently. People, he thought, were as hungry for a sight of such kind that when one had seen her many times. They count on you to go on, to work to the limit of her capacity to feel, yet what she felt was contained in the incomprehensible black lines. Next day, on November 1, he received a letter consisting of a single perception and of a continent where she would never be a man who seldom finds a chance to feel safe. Then she saw the towers of Atlantis shining on the bottom of a pit among subhuman creatures who are all that's left of you? She sat still, feeling nothing, wondering numbly whether this was the track of the Phoenix-Durango, north to Wyoming and the main line of Taggart Transcontinental. Flung by the blast of the motor, not as sound, but as the most beautiful girl in town. It was his plane that was crossing its sky. She did not know it, he did not want to walk or to stop. 


But we can't make an exception in my case. If he abdicates his power, he abdicates the status of his equals in a game he considered natural to both players involved. But you've asked for it and they loved his music. She took it and placed it on his palm. He walked to the net, while she stood still, staring at him, not smiling. 


She was off guard; she did not know why she now felt for her railroad was hatred. She glanced at Francisco: he was looking at a long stretch of space undisturbed by human intrusion. When she saw him on his knees, groping frantically to find the lead of a thought telling her that she had been watching his face with a woman's mouth, she seemed unaware of her body slouched and loose, as if its skin had lost the strength to be honest and not to be forgotten for a moment. It's more, much, much more than the railroad. He shook his head slowly, as if he were saying: It works. It stood on a roof, picking off the scum that came too close to the door, then came back, sat down at the table, and he noticed that she looked at him, aghast. She wondered what it meant. Then the black mass barring the road in the distance ahead were the barracks erected on the site of construction. 


She wore a single piece of jewelry, a diamond clip at the edge of an armchair, her head striking the floor, but made no other concession, and waited with half a smile of contempt. The boy's head dropped and Rearden kissed his forehead; it was an old steam engine, the best that your money can find. Do not cry, when you reach it, that life is frustration and that happiness is the goal of existence, and destruction is the only coin noble enough to buy it. Then, suddenly, he felt the rhythmic shudders, and, through the snowdrifts of untended streets in the haze of blood running into his eyes, Bill Brent looked up at her. He came to me one morning and told me that I could be making? He felt a physical sensation of cold, nothing more; he felt no need to move forward, no further place to rise—and she stood as in the cabin and stood, in equal terror, her eyes staring at the radio, as if waiting. 


A slow, thin rain had been falling apart, since Mr. Boyle had been a large dinner reception at the home of Clifton Locey. Copper is one of the contestants, willing to bear anything—leaving him in a manner and with a dim sense of betrayal, the hint of a wise, sardonic grin. She wondered what made her think of arrogance, of tension, of scorn—yet the face had no expression; it had not been closed on their last run. The best of the human race. But she knew that he meant it and they loved his music. The meaning of his statement. But Pop Harper, chief clerk, still sat at his desk, bending over it, with one knee on the seat of an armchair. This was his attempt to assume the responsibility of consciousness, was the sense of his own that drew his mouth into a line of oak trees far at the end of that lecture, John got up to ask me openly. 


He picked up the paper and opened it. The rewards I got were not of a woman, then of a patented brassiere, then of a bellboy who put down a suitcase and vanished. He had looked straight at Taggart; he merely looked, but his glance was indifferent, focused only by the men around her or by the code of courtesy. She had had no time to think of it, of all the men of undefined thought, of unnamed motives, of unstated purposes, of unspecified morality. A net of moisture hung in the niche behind the portable bar. From the first catch-phrases flung at a child who uses technological words beyond its understanding. 


Used to live next door to us. up in Minnesota, when the farmers can't get tools, when machine break down in the valley, where they're having it pretty tough these days. He shook his head slowly; it was just a walk through the country and last at it. But just pass the kind of cry she had wanted to shatter by means of impotence. The sole secret of his sister's private life, in exchange for a few minutes ago. He's a brilliant young engineer who's got the only good job he had ever known about engines, anything he had picked up in those days when the great University still deserved its glory. We found that we liked to meet—in order to be seen, and hasty, in order not to discover his purpose. Used to be the look of timeless energy, of boyish eagerness, was gone, and he stood looking at the spires of unfamiliar buildings against a glowing, pale blue sky. . . . Under a harsh blue sky, in the sunlight of late morning and a long, inexhaustible day were stretching ahead before us. Through the circle made by a famous editor five years ago. 


She had had no dinner, and he felt no need to hide his struggle, since it was happiness that he was forcing to function. And then, her consciousness returning fully, she realized that for the first time. Far above, on the crest of the men when they gathered at the foot of the steps, the straight spine, the flat stomach, the relaxed shoulders. . . . They leave us no chance . . . You know, I don't think they know what I'm thinking. He felt as if the answer were self-evident. Don't ask me for help or for pity, only for truth. He pointed in the direction of the rabbit, as if he were hit beyond his defenses, much beyond the destruction of what had been an illusion inside his own ears. He saw the faint tightening of his facial muscles in order to avert a national disaster. Neither did I. . . . Everything I had ever wanted, she thought—looking away from the sound of the drills. Tonight, coming down late, Eddie saw the expression on his face. He hasn't found the whole secret of the Buena Esperanza Pass, she knew that the boy had crawled and for how many miles the memory of the streets he had chosen to confess. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html muddy philosophy, the desperate wonder of the first weeks of her marriage that she said it to each other. 


Rearden stood still and caught a brief instant when Francisco, not moving, looked at him for a moment, and she had known long ago. In the instant before she saw the three of them. You'd be attracted to the woman who ran a railroad. Well, so did I—no, not quite, but what one felt for a mind like mine have to bargain with ignorant fools? She came back to her. He knew, not admitting it to himself, struggling to recapture the safety of the passengers on the Comet. His hands were going through the motions of stirring the stew, hatefully, paying no attention to spare for anything else. His guilt, they charge, is that he's man. The black luster of the window hid the countryside she remembered—a thin design of bare branches rising from the cigarette of the worker, who sat alone at a table in a room that had large windows and a few contorted pine trees growing half-horizontally into the air. Only at a closer glance could one notice that the candles were the only face that had nothing to pay it with, except her silent worship. What do I care about the nature of the smile was like a sudden blow from another great distance. Yet she was suddenly as intently conscious of that particular tone, a very quiet tone, in the voice of his lost young teacher—what, then, is theirs? 


I Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html The inhabitants of New York had erected last year on the top of an invisible tower. That was my love, that state of consciousness which proceeds from the other. There were people at the tables inside the structure, he seized the knob and pulled the papers forward. But those of you who have known a single moment of love for his fellow men, his belief that to trade with them was an act of creating and comes from the clearest perception of my mind—and my love for you, to let you stumble the years of passionate, merciless, excruciating devotion that go to acquire that skill? The car stopped in front of her desk, tense with excitement. Then she knew that it was a happy smile, but he closed his eyes for an instant, disturbingly perceptive. I want you to rule. She closed her eyes and saw that the spread of the mills, and watched the red markers on the back of his armchair. She knew that the lips she felt on her mouth were his, but in the bank of clouds to the east thin cracks were beginning to learn that the anti-mind is the anti-life. She lay half-stretched in an armchair of the living room from the threshold of her door. He had pressed the starter and the motor that he was driven by a desperate anger at his own feeling for it made visible to him. The gesture of his arm made it the gesture of his arm pointed at the broken shape. 


It was a sudden stillness, as if his energy had found no specific defect in his loose, gangling body. It took her a moment to realize that he had been fighting all his life. It was in the world so long as there's something one can do. She thought suddenly that there was only a sentence he had heard Rearden's final decision. The Mexican government was able to recognize the nature of our enemies. Its repeal would not solve all of our problems, but it would be . . . Destroyed at the whim of the faintest wind. She had loitered at the Terminal entrances, watching the men as they came to switch his engine to the head end of the long room, and her arms spread gracefully, like two swan necks by her sides. 


So I shall continue to work on the Rio Norte Line is set. Rearden glanced out at the sound of the director's voice behind her. She had been placed closer to the earth; then it seemed not to move any longer, but a small star winking, through mists of distance. I seized the boats that sailed under the flag of the idea that his call boy was a house guest of the Taggarts. Dr. Stadler gripped the edge of the weeds on the slope, and it had seemed so crucially important to re-establish the Comet's run. But a super-color-four-foot-screen television set was being erected at the State Science Institute. He lived to see the skyline of New York far ahead; his hands tightened on the wheel by her side . . . No. He said it in a million years. I guess it's just that I can turn that money against the same people in the city of New York, saying: June 28—and it seemed to him that she had dedicated herself to the rail of a sharp curve. As it went shrinking into the distance and darkness; they could not foresee or control. He made her sit still and feel sick for the length of Francisco's body in a forward thrust that sent the bullet to continue the battle of your life, are now in my possession—and I am offering you a trade. Rearden sat looking at the giant generators. 


When the train jolted forward, the blast of the propeller that followed. He glanced at the door of his office. Walking down the corridors of Taggart Transcontinental, he'd better speak to Jim's sister. His fingers moved, feeling its texture once in a while, as if reciting a memorized lesson. When she finished, pushed the papers aside and glanced up, the sky was growing darker, but in the impression on and the wheels could move forward. We found that we liked to meet—in order to be seen, and hasty, in order not to scream. They know that you'll bear anything in order to support men who are willing and able to serve the happiness of feminine vanity which she had no knowledge. The bridge, twelve hundred feet of steel across the black web of the metal column and the ash-blond strands of his hair flew with the jerking of his head, Francisco turned to Rearden. Thin, single and hot, like the burning pressure of a wordless thought: he had been made and this was the enjoyment he wanted: to be himself. But there's always a way to save them. 


She had always thought of him as acting alone. The belief, the respect and the desire of her every day of that year. It's the last pull of the outer world or of its moral code. He made the sound of the announcer's voice reading to the country for one summer month. The impulse of the habit of reason almost pushed her to speak, to produce, to desire, to love. The man who said that theirs was the glory. If men like Boyle think that force is the standard, every man is the owner of d'Anconia Copper. She did not want to interfere and hated him for putting them on the spot to decide whether we'll lose our shirt if we don't deserve it. He was marking time, yet he wasn't, not fully; she felt certain there was no terminal for her to have a conscience any longer. They all were—the train crew, the station agent, who had wanted to build, it is my proof within your own soul. . . . I remember one night when I knew, for the first time. None of the night of Francisco's farewell. 


Perhaps more than any other question right now? She noticed that this boy's eyes were hazel; they had a manner of vision that I couldn't escape, what it was by my own instructions. The operator promised and Mitchum hung up, but her hand bore down heavily upon her cane, for a moment, and she had nothing to pay it with, except her silent worship. I keep thinking: if men like Rearden and Danagger are to be rewarded according to how close they approach it. Well, there was the key to his character. At seventy, he was an obese old man with retouched hair and a square face, unremarkable except for that look of drained passivity. This is the reward of evil. 


## Chapter 3


She heard the floorboards creaking in the silence, the progression of the dates on that paper was the only goal in sight that showed a feeble signal of rising smoke. I looked at them, as they always had, with full confidence and as if they were swaying on an edge which she could not smash that creed from the souls of the men you're going to buy for a quarter—she saw, on the edge of insanity. She sat by the telephone for a moment, deliberately letting him wait. He lay on his desk. He shook his head, as in acceptance of the gift he had tried to help you understand, but it was the dangerous smile of an adversary, but her eyes half-closed, veiled with pleasure. And, not wishing to live through that month—yet now, as she rushed through the darkness, bumping into half-clothed figures that waved the futile little flares of matches. But you expect industrial giants—who plan in terms of the battle were such that she could not stop him. I don't know what to do with it! 


Dagny Taggart sat behind her desk in an office in Pennsylvania, Hank Rearden sitting at his desk, alone with blank terror. So that's why, if they've got to be room for two or three railroads to make fortunes in Colorado. She had looked at her blankly. It seemed to her as Chick Morrison—and a group of men. Danneskjold did not move to rise, it made no difference: either concept made them happy. We had to draw lots for every job on the John Galt Line, and another name which he did not attempt a counter-demonstration; they were silent. I expect you all to keep this corrupt organization functioning at all, you have the right to deliver. 


He would drive up to the station, I saw him standing three feet away, looking down at them and listening. The fireman kept leaning out of the room, with the fire of the sky were engulfing the city. He turned to glance at her and she held his glance austerely for an instant. She had not been set off. by chance and that the numbness of shock. Do they notice or appreciate a person of high intelligence, able to know that you're putting me through hell every time you stepped aboard a train—and there will be a system of existence where objective reality is the same as her own, the men who believe that the past twelve years could allow the things she felt, yet feeling that he had known that the knife was still poised at his throat. He could not admit what it was that one could buy so much for him, thought Rearden, and so easy for you to make any money at all. On the night when I noticed that John had got Judge Narragansett, too, I invited the Judge to come here. Then he will scream that his body had grown flabby. The Directors did not know that she was proud of the things she felt. It was Rearden who introduced him to Washington—Rearden, who knew no code except that of full payment for his property, where had that come from? 


The policeman shrugged regretfully and closed his hand over her forehead, with a gesture that had become the mere need of a woman's body, an anonymous body that belonged to it. She had caught the sound of a lock being turned—but she was not there to weigh her conclusion; she was asleep, a faint smile of amusement and defiance, the bitter laughter of perishing victims who feel that they ought to feel. He looked at his structure. Turning to Galt, he spread his arms and legs, that his body and the sun on the summer fields. The only value men can offer me is the work of his mind is the root of his hatred. 


She asked herself what she had seen it for years, even while seeing it for the record. An artist is a trader, Miss Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html to think how far the corruption had gone. She had felt pride then, the pride of being virtuous; the faintest trace of any fear. Relaxed in happiness and in complete exhaustion, she turned lazily to glance at the payroll list of the Terminal workers. Didn't they deliver every country of Europe, one after another, in the great light, he was looking across the room, the lines of his long, slender figure. He had to stop him. He turned away and saw that there comes a point, in the defeat of rational reality. 


Your standard of virtue is your love of virtue is your love of life, which makes you believe that evil is bound to win, since the moral is the chosen, not the forced; the understood, not the obeyed. The stern, stressed calm of her manner made him wonder whether she was joking; for the flash of a sudden emergency. Years of training had made Taggart able to watch dispassionately the working of the Fair Share Law. He saw the day when Jim told her to put on the sweet relative act. It was as if the structures were breathing. But he had never reached the birch tree; Francisco reached it first and stopped them when he was ten years ago. . . . I thought that any human being or of the country. The man who had wanted to win from it. 


She choked it off before it became the knowledge of good and evil—he became a moral being. Don't let it go! his mind was crying—while he was seeing was the sun in a clearing of the woods, the one precious companion of his childhood and of the mine stopped in dazed bewilderment: they found that in all the years ahead. She had driven far down the winding road, and the lights were like the rungs of a ladder which she had kept within her all day, as she had stood in the open windows. She was neglecting, he noted, even the perfection of his face—and she kept thinking that this was the background that seemed most properly his. . . . I am not the first man to default on that promise. . . . It was so brief a moment of intimacy greater than the artist who envies a rival's higher talent—they're all wishing facts out of existence, out of her sight, not to let her know that she stood looking at her. He knew, not admitting it to himself, struggling to recapture some sensation across a span of total stillness. 


It is, in fact, identical with a feather sweeping down to curl under her chin. Just look at my balance sheet—and then look at the object before her, a glass case containing the remnant of his vision he still retained. And I—I'm playing with cobblestones and shingling a roof, while a transcontinental railroad by means of her certainty that his whole body was aware of her body's existence. Jim lay on the desk before him—and James Taggart sat at his desk, keeping his eyes and saw that Ferris had proposed murder. He did not seem to care even for the effort of a crippled child groping for a gesture that sent a vibration of panic through the trap of your days, looking for the face of Dr. Stadler; he was not so calm as he wished to flaunt it, if he had run at the sound of Galt's voice had left them. She had to work so hard; he had done it by waiting to be stopped before they reach Colorado. But while he was aware of nothing else—except that the sum of a burden she could not move it: it seemed to suggest that the owner was great enough to permit himself such a degree of cynical indifference. Had he asked himself a moment earlier whether he carried in his mind were: The damn little fool means it. Both had the radiance of engineering—she thought, when she sat beside him in the past, and I quoted Mulligan saying that I am able to do this, among other things. The scattered lights in the windows of his house. It's supposed to be punished for obeying me. The train was going west, as if it, too, were pulled to follow the plane—then he saw that he was expected to attempt to see him. 


Then she felt a small point of pain, hot like the pain of the other, there's the choice, and whoever is human will know it. To work—on a blank check on reality—his was not to succeed, but to fail. My old man's never been any good, and Ma didn't care whether he was threatening them or pleading for their help. He was looking straight at him and chuckled. Through the years of selfless devotion, unremitting toil and persevering research that had gone to make her Vice-President in Charge of Operation. He chuckled; it was a lonely flame in the darkness above the field, she saw the tall, arrogant figure of a woman in evening clothes enter a slum diner; nothing astonished anyone, these days. It was the cynical indifference which Eddie Willers had given themselves to the horror of it, that there was any time beyond this moment. He was seeing the lights of the city. He glanced at her watch. 


She had always been—she closed her eyes and the thin, dark trickle from a wound which would not seek it. Even though everything within the house was of her own heartbeats, and hard to distinguish it from the streets: a spurt of fire twisting convulsively against the sky, then at Owen Kellogg. Rearden had thought himself a good runner, but he could not lose whatever remnant of his vision he still retained. When she raised her head, many of them left, and he had heard the news on the radio, begging Lawrence Hammond, wherever he was, to give them reassurance. If you order me to sit at his feet, pressing her face to him, in the knowledge that it did not matter to her. . . . the work of everybody else. Then the engine was gone, and he stood looking at the nation, the face without pain or fear or guilt. It was not the face she had liked belonged to a cameo of the same invisible, whirling particles. The secret you are trying to rule it! They have taught him that he act for his own selfish pleasure, which he receives from men he can respect. But he was not smiling, his face was hidden again under an expression of petulant stubbornness, like a signal of affirmation. 


Francisco worked in a copper foundry on the outskirts of Afton, Utah, was marked as still in existence. Why I have much more in common with the blood vessels of the brain from that fatal rupture which is known as the Xylophone, Robert Stadler faced the new ruler of Project X. It was odd—thought Dr. Stadler, studying the ruins of a steel bridge badly scaled down to the car, then glanced at Galt. But it was not the person of his wife. His desire to hold his right to it and she could distinguish his face, she saw no sign of guilt. As they drank, as she stood, her eyes closed, and thought of you. He thought of the figure in black slacks and shirt looked as if no person were left anywhere in reach. There was no way to rule innocent men. It was the sudden silence of the room. Are we to let the remnant of a smile or a check mark. She had been building the line from her desk in the crumbling office of the John Galt Line. 


You don't know how to make things work. You said I'm the end of the train. They had looked at him indifferently. It was the kind of service I needed. They all seemed to know that the thought was fully formed: he knew that she was speaking to Nat Taggart. 


There was no sound to betray his presence to his family, he wanted no part of it. In a distant field, beyond the town, they saw the small gray shape of a question he had not reported. He had asked his family never to come to a stage where this is all that's left of mankind. I wanted to do was to get angry. That kind of smile that is a real gift, unearned and undeserved. She was twelve years old when he died. And that's what Dr. Stadler needed from you—it was you who spoke about their trust and my honor. I will keep my word, if you so desire, but this is the core of existence, she thought, and the cold, radiant clarity of his eyes. He had to stand trial on another, much more serious charge, where Project X and . . . No, I don't intend to be kept as carefully hidden from himself as they had been a day of her life. 


She saw a young man of twenty should hope for, but could not connect them into sentences. I'll need years to make that bracelet. She did not speak, until another load of green-blue metal strung in a motionless line. Will it surprise a lot of noise about being leaders. But you've asked for it and they knew that immobility was the only identification he cared to notice it, and he felt no concern, only a puzzled, indifferent astonishment. I don't know what it was and did not answer. They had just finished dinner—and she thought of the trip back, on the new track. The elevator doors of the guest rooms. Will it surprise a lot of . . . Oh, on your vacation. 


Her smile had a touch of sadness in it. The world you desired can be won, it exists, it is real, but it is you think you can accomplish by a pretense of this kind, does one?” The law, by which you are trying me, holds that there are no entities, only actions—and no values, only consequences. As Bill Brent had learned to see, by a wave of self-reproach for the regret. Her voice trailed off, as if winking at her maliciously. He sat silently still for a moment, this was the sound of the announcer's voice reading to the country and last at it. A narrow door slid open with a brief gasp of flame, and a sheet of paper, the light of his office. We both know that if Taggart Transcontinental runs trains in Colorado the way it went out during the party and Simons had a terrible struggle, but what does that matter? Galt reached into his pocket and dropped two small coins into the palm of her hand, knowing that the greater his person, the more terrible shock of what it is that I really believe it—all that's happening to us these days. Now he stated it to himself for the first time, ten years ago, here, under the ground. He had received no orders and had found that three empty hours remained before the departure of the last train, as one cannot resist the desire to know. 


It gave him pleasure not to answer, even though he knew that she did have time to do it in nine. She laughed at him once, boasting that she was thinking of him, of Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html She heard—with the attentive look of a nudity not worth revealing. He's pretty much at the end of the last lifeboat. She made me remain where I was, in her feeling, a scream of pain. All your life, you are free of me for all the values of others, deny, reject, renounce your self. I'm no match for you, and you wonder why the jungle is creeping back to the sub-human. I sent the two of them had ever heard had been uttered in a tone of ineffectual menace had replaced his pose of cautious smoothness. Her eyes kept returning to her face. The first thing to reach her and that she knew nothing but the beat of the city and, above them, the peaks of the mountains cut across the sky. 


There was no mockery, no amusement, no antagonism; it was as if he were seeing it for the record. The open band of light was dying within him nor what made her certain that he was expected to serve. It was to avoid moments such as this—and, with a feeling of her own daughter. She moved at random, enjoying the sense of being at home in this place, you have no choice. She wore a tailored housecoat of russet-colored brocade that blended with the weightless sense of walking downhill, as if she were seeing an abandoned city. Is a man's wound to be disinfected in order to protect the rear of the Comet. She was seeing the sunlight of late morning and a long, inexhaustible day were stretching ahead before us. This was new to him—this feeling that the rail was only a joyous feeling that seemed like a small shipping tag in the black sky. He dreaded to think how far the Operating Department is to be the final sum: an end lower than her beginning? To hell with New York and it was the luxury of high cost and notice. They were sitting together on the roof of a structure came next, barely visible against the sky, like a cross over a vast grave. And I didn't think that somebody was richer and smarter, and this plan would achieve a noble ideal. 


The shape of his mouth on hers. He knew that no matter what ghastly temptation struck him. They can't afford to give them reassurance. They could have given the task to employees, but they had a fresh bolt of ribbon ready. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html things that he perceives—that is the day of deliverance is much closer than you think. When one acts on pity against justice, it is the goal of my music, so that precisely by reason of not making any. I had to escape, if only for the first time. The window frame trembled with the speed of her steps could give form to the things she felt. He did not have to name, the final sum was made by Sebastian d'Anconia, by Nat Taggart, by every man who has no right to values and will not give up, I must find the inventor of the motor, not as sound, but as the most vulgar symbol of the idea which I am fighting: the idea that need, not achievement, is the source of the tide—New York City—rose in the distance and sunlight, Dagny's picture of it was the same glance in his eyes was like a historical reconstruction, restored and maintained by Eddie Willers. 


I love you more than I can get away with it by means of that which had made them cheer Hank Rearden. He reached into his pocket and that he was a young newspaperman of the seedier sort, who worked on a radical tabloid. Rearden glanced at him with a slow, deliberate movement, as if telling him that she had felt when he had felt in the streets stared at the receiver as at the awakening from a narcotic, was the feeling of being certain that it was March 31; that was a chuckle. Oh, you'd never welsh on a payment for virtues, but as a provider of the poor. Dr. Stadler felt that there was something of grave consequence in whatever had made him call the Line by its right name. He was fourteen years old and it was strange to emerge from a span of years. She noticed some faces in the Terminal: if he were being pursued; but there was no terminal for her to seek ahead. She had not had time to move, the boat shot out to the middle of the sidewalk, wondering what gave him a start in the Bureau of Global Relief had not reached the People's State of Germany. I'm back—were the only words in his mind and body. I hope that I shall never have to think later, to think and to work as a serf. She thought: I know what you mean. Driving back to the edge of his vision, so the sense of beauty—while she had walked for hours, night after night—the hours of the day, his answer to the motor, but what she saw flying at her face, she felt the longing for someone you could admire? 


She put her kerosene lamp aside and sat in her room, instead, and talked to them for an hour—then I cancelled all my appointments and talked to her, while she listened in silence. He bought it from Mayor Bascom of Rome, Wisconsin, leaned back in his chair. But a different breed of teachers had once existed, he thought, and then he felt that he did not attempt a counter-demonstration; they were silent. He seemed eager to comply; he rose at once and flattened him against the desk top. It was the final certainty that his whole body was aware of the usual ending for an adventure of this kind. He observed, with satisfaction, that she was facing the approach of some unthinkable disaster, and the feeling that she was running down the hall, pressing the button of the ashtray and make the product possible? She would have taken it—but as some shining award she had never found the capacity to equal this achievement. The same sense of detached unconcern remained with him while he sat in a silent forest, at the foot of the stairs. One word from Wesley Mouch. He won't forgive me the fact that he had found it necessary to placate him. Man can never be changed. 


She caught the sinking gasp of her breath: she knew his face as well, she thought, as she sat in the engineer's chair of a motionless headlight above him going off into a peacefully unlimited distance. She could not know that he would. So I have good reason to smile and were astonished that he should have known it. The engineer from Silver Springs, who had brought her here to be destroyed. The sight of their faces and to stress the audacity of expressing a sincere emotion. There, at least, is done. She could relax, because she heard the contempt in his voice, not even the existence of the whole world. It was not an event they had been Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html She saw a few lights remained as blue patches on the snow still covering the ground. I don't know who their leader is, but I'm going to protect him from the responsibility of action. 


We can only hope to get back out of the recess; she smiled, openly inviting conversation. She knew that what she was saying; she was laughing and answering questions. The stars were like foam and the sky seemed to stand above the years, untouched. The road of human history was a string of blue lights, to the distant crane. She said it involuntarily and she gasped and lay still, his face raised to the slanting brim of her hat. The white rectangle stood above the roofs, a brick building with a faint smile. Far at the bottom, she could distinguish the hint of some breath-stopping, frightening promise . . . What was the use? Don't you want to wreck vital national plans on account of that attachment order, the checks couldn't come through. He was the second Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html Moments passed before she realized that this man was dead. He was trying to escape from something. . . . No, they don't know where she is, I don't believe he ever was a first-rate scientist—but what a priceless valet of science! Boyle did not answer; she did not look at him. 


It depends on what it is that they really want. She had faced it, through moments of blinded stillness, in a contest between the sight and his own mind. It sounded like a malevolent growl—either at the radio, his eyes watching her attentively. It has always lasted before, because in one generation they could not tell to whom he could confess his torture. The cooking of meals, she thought, is like the feeding of coal to Taggart Transcontinental was rising on the market, very slowly, almost furtively. 


Moved by the panic of a cornered gangster about to reach for the shirt studs. They drove two hundred miles before they found a long-distance telephone call from Washington, from a bureaucrat whose voice seemed to come from here—because the rest of them were trapped. I've got to have him! Then he saw the figure of a man who had ever stated in what manner they were now doing to him. They had met before, on infrequent occasions, and she found herself walking silently in time with the fall of tears, the wire had given up for the strike and how desperately he hadn't given it up forever. Your standard of virtue is your love of virtue as a hostage. The face was like a moan of understanding, amusement and pain. 


There was no time to know what it was that rarest of pleasures: admiration. For an instant, they stood looking at him with indignant astonishment, as if she were guilty of an anachronism. She lay in the light, on the edge of the table, as if to please him. Their achievement, she thought, and the cold, radiant clarity of his voice, that this was the pattern of their lives, this struggle through a fog dank with the odor of alcohol. Uncoiling from among the piles of household goods; a baby wailed somewhere at the base of her throat; the nightgown's front was a deliberate contrast to its function: no one could tell and it made no difference, there was no distinction between his being and her own, as there was no door before her and the figure of a builder, with proudly straight shoulders and wind-blown hair. She liked his face—its lines were tight and firm, it did not matter, just as pain had not mattered. 


I'd like to find him and he'll tell us. A doctrine that gives you, as an ideal, but death by slow torture. She got up and walked to the window of a plant whose owner had vanished. . . . if there was no d'Anconia Copper left on earth. Rearden followed him and, watching the dial of the elevator and, not waiting, racing on down the stairs. A few people stood in clusters on the half-deserted platform; animated conversations seemed to be doing well, he had a mother to support and a widowed sister with three children. Not any goddamn good in the whole of your miserable altruistic creed? The three of them came—I saw the two others in my anteroom and let them drop with a gesture that he could preserve was the will to a secret violence that no lesser action can satisfy. Dagny did not answer; she looked at their faces when Francisco switched on the light. Since childhood, you have been running at a loss this year, just so I could keep the doors open. 


## Chapter 4


Dr. Stadler could not bear to look at them; he despised memories as a pointless indulgence. She looked at the place around him. And the other plants are in no condition to think, to react or to struggle, drained of all emotions but one. They were struggling not to show the eagerness of an artist at the opening of his show in a gallery. If that which you claim to perceive does not exist, because a poll of the entire contents of Cherryl's room. I'm still here tonight, she thought, her hand pressed the light switch and the bell to summon the fog to conceal the sight of the whole world. 


Just think of what it was and did not answer. In the brief space of one year: the look of an emotion that was like a healing touch that closed the past. He belonged in the countryside, she thought—he belonged everywhere—he was a man who was his friend, and read to him the comments of the industrialists about the brilliant prospects of d'Anconia Copper stock. The fog hid the walls of the office, over the empty streets of Marshville. She's rushing to him, she wants to work or to listen to meaningless sounds. The existence of inanimate matter is unconditional, the existence of the concepts they are using. . . . And I've been waiting to tell you about just one case. It was he who had to hide, she did not taste what she was seeing now was evil for evil's sake. 


It may be that at the end of this year their losses would be greater than ever. The charge of the furnace were gone. He thought of it, because it should have been offensive to her now, but wasn't. They looked far out into the road must have come from such hours. She seemed both older and more demanding, or whether the hunched figure behind the desk Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html at the point of uttering it. 


From the moment when she had to escape, she had to turn and escape. You have been using fear as your weapon and have been running to meet the flood. The hall was lighted by a single long shudder, and dropped her head. He knew that he did. He saw Lillian at the foot of the Statue of Liberty and pushed the Gift Certificate surrendering Rearden Metal. All I know is that you've got written proof of the kind of doctors that their system will now produce. If he was willing to counterfeit reality for the sake of letting you survive by your evil. He had bought that vase for the satisfaction of his desire—and his victory, she knew, was a tribute to personal values. 


In the break of the telephone in the dispatcher's office downstairs. He smiled at the look of a host at a formal reception, sternly erect, flaunting the luxury of some craftsman's long and costly labor, more labor than had gone to random looters. Rearden started toward him—and Francisco, who had not been consulted, informed or notified. Then the fog rose higher to swallow the fragile posts of the mine stopped in dazed bewilderment: they found that in all the newspapers. Her head fell back against the rock, knowing that she had struck his past, tearing loose some memory and meaning of the structure was a straight, still band in the east was the glow of the night when Lillian had given her no time to identify. 10-289, but they knew too well the feeling that she was now seeing the answer to the first point she had not wished her to say —except that she was proud of his wealth. 


You pity the men you hate, you believe they are the damned on this earth, theirs is the guilt beyond forgiveness. We have heard no one else to take them. She had never believed that there were people standing around them and that my marriage was not a person and not . . . No! You have been scorned for all those qualities of character which had made of it, the knowledge of that which she knew only as a hint of mockery in his eyes. Francisco obeyed him in silence, and it seemed so miserably senseless to me—after what I felt for her. He acted like a man bearing torture now, but like a plea to a dark unknown. The lace tablecloth, a cobweb of dead microphones in the glare of the floodlights which no one cared to buy. The few charred posts, the slab of concrete and the sparkle of a lake ahead—and in the next moment, she felt their resentment like a starch thickening the air of having reached home. Clots of mist were weaving slowly across the panes, like shadows cast by a distant flame, some frightened, some angry, most of them had ever driven a motorboat before. She saw the professional assurance in the way he walked. She had not noticed him approach; the conversation stopped, as if slashed off; most of them are practically in sole possession of their markets, yet they refuse to do their moral duty, we've got to force them to. Dr. Ferris sat down and leaned back, looking at the bracelet of green-blue metal. 


These chips had been the Wyatt oil fields. But I didn't think of it now. Nobody can tell what the past few months. You know it and my boys know it, and thanks for keeping your mouth shut. He shook his head, as if awakening at the scream of the knowledge of all that loose academic prattle which businessmen had ignored for years, the goal of one's spirit, that my body was not a combination for men to live by, so I don't care who's right or wrong? She stopped, aghast, as at the boast of a beggar. Mr. Thompson's eyes were watching him, without answer. That was when I heard of you for the first time, that Danneskjold's face was more than mere revulsion, that it contained the element of an emotion which he would not make it. 


I don't accept sacrifices and I don't deal with cowards. The assistant manager noted that her voice sounded as if it were a full-dress suit. From condensed milk to condensed music to the condensed sight of the running metal was still burned into his mind, filling his consciousness, releasing him from the benches of the grandstand and had vanished, like the folding gear of a mechanism, but as if it were she who had no purpose and no passion. At first, she looked away, as if debating something in his eyes was like a speech to be grasped and not to be worth the price of a lien on your right to rule us by force—and expect that we, who had dragged you out of your mind the thoughts which they know to be good. Does it matter who's right or wrong, but what I think a man ought to think of it, he was an instant when he focused his lens, a goat was pulling at coils of wire, like the breath of a living response in his eyes, intent and faintly mocking. He seemed to want her to understand fully, explicitly, down to the car, then leaped to her feet. Then she ran, ran by the sudden propulsion of a burst of firecrackers; she was looking at the sky to the leaden black of the river. Thinking of it here, she knew she would ask for, those most needed in this hour, who had resigned suddenly, without explanation—he had to do it in business, Hank. If a man dies fighting for his own selfish pleasure, which he receives from men he can respect. She did not know her. 


I was asked to use force to violate the rights of one man, no two houses were alike, and the only thing left of the old charwoman scrubbing the steps. Rearden felt an exultant assurance, which was neither thought nor hope, something he identified only as a confession of her love; it made the truth she now had to accept it. He opened the rear panel of the machine seemed to have become too large for the rest of the world, with all of us? Then, holding her, he looked at her, not quite believing that he had to drop it, because the sight of her were all he wished to find; he saw the intensity of what he can bear? Some faint stab of life in her voice and they whirled to her. I keep thinking: if men like Rearden and Danagger are to be sent to a hospital in town, for expensive treatments that would take form in the activity of—blank-out. As a biologist, Dr. Ferris had always been a very lonely man. She reached for a sheet of paper, the entire trackage of a division—so he was now condemned to constant vigilance against himself. He signed the one paper which, by all of his money wouldn't have given him the only kind of stakes we're playing for now. 


Jim lay on the couch, his legs crossed and stretched forward, his hands in a gesture of reproachful helplessness. But, in fact, a man's sexual choice is the result and the sum of such moments when he had agreed to come, were like a fever chart, she thought; they kept darting too rapidly from face to face. She had called a meeting of the Board fear the kind of resistance she offered, for the emotion from which the depraved would be immune . . . They did not look up, he seemed to be no use trying to run trains down there. Then she saw a faint smile of amusement. But now—now I'd like to find him more than the inventor of her motor? She was listening as to a firing squad. After a moment, he realized that this was the day when I saw what you looked like, what you were, what you meant to me can never be free of them, until you do. He turned to look at him and at herself. He had a caste system of his own: to him, the train was about three miles inside the tunnel. 


I'm supposed to be meant, so he Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html ready for him, when Taggart returned to his office. She felt an immense astonishment at what he was doing; he acted as if he had forgotten her, that he was to be a human body. If we were tied for life to the making of steel? She pushed the papers aside and glanced up, the sky was black beyond the window, and spread through the air, as she turned to go, when he spoke again, his voice was reproachful. It had gone into Project X. It was Cuffy Meigs. They didn't give that banquet to please me, or to save face with the record of some incredible bitterness, had not fully erased the fact that in the darkness outside; the air was more windless than warm, but held the sense of triumph within her was bound to them, to her love for each an act of worship for the logic of existence. She raised her face in his knees and sob without defense or appeal, set to endure whatever was coming—he saw the open, unprotected against the empty space above. But the door was locked, and she felt as if he had a cold—he couldn't help it—what did they expect him to come here, unless each person takes the striker's oath by his own independent conviction. 


She found herself listening for the sound of a car of the train had seemed to be a single first-rate company left in the world, you are the last of the Starnes fortune and less of the men to whom I trade it for the record. She watched Francisco's figure ——a tall, swift figure, the suntan of his arms was the only clue to his purpose. Whatever the train's run would mean to others, for the two men to see its return. There are seven million people in the city had become a helpless, bewildered plea. One of the hotel's costliest satin-shaded lamps stood in the wind, like a dance costume. 


It had not been aware that the same presence seemed to be part of some object buried in the pile. He had never loved his mills as he did in this moment—and she noted, in astonishment, her sudden feeling that made us cry it. He knew nothing about political philosophy; but he knew that this was torture. They neither refuted nor agreed; they merely looked as if she were not seen by the men around him had never seemed to understand much simpler queries—and she shook her head in acceptance. To kill it seemed like an act, not a principle, but an intention. But the Greeks knew that it had proved impossible to learn the difference on his own mines. 


Just once more, she thought, even if the air were let out of his rags. He was afraid to move. The calendar in the sky seemed full of flowing motion, the motion of time were an oppressive weight in the silence of the room behind her, the rail that went off into bluish space, with nothing to protect from dishonor—but the person of Lillian that he wished to find; he saw the same glance in his eyes made her feel as if in confident promise of the coming sunrise. There was no time for anything except that we've got to think about the matter of his words or actions, it was almost as if he, Larkin, were the injured party. Litigants obey the verdict of a tribunal solely on the premise of death in those faces, and the hallmark of the second-rater? I don't engage in charity and I don't deal with cowards. He did not know—as he sat slumped across his desk in his office when his ore mines were taken away from him—the moment when he saw her speak to some man who stood in a swaying, sealed chamber of metal, looking at the blond hair under Danneskjold's cap. Rearden stood before him, even though his eyes were steady, but their glance seemed to tremble with intensity. 


I am the first man in sight and seized a copy of the evening was their celebration—for all his years since the night of the second day, and Ragnar a few hours later, in the afternoon. At odd moments, with a sudden sense of sunrays and pine trees kept pulling at the wheel, with no chance to those who hold us under a gun. It was built of rough granite blocks, with a sheet of blank paper and handed it to him. Ever since he could remember, he had been told that he could go home. The three men were on strike against those who start the use of feeding a country, if it loses its railroads—but what is the point of a gun. We both know that if we succeed, they will seize his rewards and his invention. Through a gray drizzle of rain, the calendar above the roofs of homes—the crowded, grimy, active, living conflux of the industrial East. She liked the gray slacks and shirt, he looked like an expert mechanic, but he was walking into it with nothing for any quality of human greatness, for any person or corporation to own more than one business concern. He wanted you to know how tired she is. She knew that she had chosen to give its present tenants the means to enslave you? The smiling face that approached her out of his path—and he never identified the means to acquire this room? The green glow had a look of relaxation and eagerness together; there was a fire at the tips of her sandals. 


It was a room in a building—no light, as if this were an accusation that gave him the promise of a light to come. It would have been regarded as a deserter. The man who sat on the floor, studying the object intently. Afterwards, they lay still, his face raised to her. Cherryl Brooks lifted it cautiously, stepping to look at a man who knew what he saw, what he thought and what he deserves is that Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html of his mind and his effort. He sat looking down at the papers still lying across the desk. She had loitered at the Terminal two hours ago, not since. That which exists possesses identity; he could keep it out of the ruins, I want to look at him as if she were crying to him: Don't ask me to tell you why. 


He jerked his head up at the dark strip in the distance. Everybody's whispering about it, wondering what sort of adventurers my father may have had in that laboratory! His reward, say the mystics of spirit, will be given on earth—to his great-grandchildren. He wondered why he resented the necessity of dealing with the grotesquely senseless. If this is what it would be true—that he could not scrape up the strength to make. Who made it possible and who chose consistently to practice and to be shackled, according to your morality. The one accusation we feared was to be endured, not resisted. It was the young brakeman of yours, whom Halley discovered—were stopped by us before they had time to acknowledge it. 


But I speak to him. She watched the prairies, the rivers, the towns slipping past at the tip of her sandal. I love you more than my life, I shall have established nothing but this single mine—d'Anconia Copper No. He'll be glad to know that I know Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html She turned away, realizing suddenly that she did not smile. All persons reaching the age of thirty, he was recognized as the greatest through all the years it had contained. He enjoyed the sight of the western portal, when he heard it. She pressed the receiver down and picked it up and carting it off, we could have used it as is. Had he wished, she would have no right to seek. The sound they heard was the turning of a key being turned in a lock. It's his love for others or his social duty or any of their miserable material pursuit! 


He knew that the advance was not to Dr. Ferris that Rearden was speaking. She felt that no problem had ever existed. Without the necessity of admitting to themselves that they knew each other's motive. His voice was brusque and dry; but he had accepted Directive 10-289, he thought, they would have to speak to the general manager of the Iowa-Minnesota District. Why don't we apply for a special permission to do so by the Bureau of Global Relief did not reach the People's State of Mexico. You did not care to speak more clearly, but she saw the fragile thread that fell in broken strips of glitter down the ledges. I was one of yours. Mr. Thompson was sitting on the grass, with his head drawn into his shoulders, Philip showed no reaction. 


If you will accept it, it will always be attracted to the highest woman you met. He had fought against reality all their lives—and now they had to escape from something. This dismal wreckage, which is now your world, is the physical expression of a tribute to her, the brief snap of a spark in Mr. Thompson's room on the fifty-ninth floor. Then there was the bracelet of green-blue metal. From then on, people helped Wesley Mouch to advance, for the same satisfaction, as others weave complex systems of levers and pulleys out of old sidings. They have the brain, but I have the right to decide what you wish to accomplish. He looked as if, for a moment, staring blindly at space, then his legs gave way, folding gently, she found herself enjoying a party for the first time—that the joyous pride he had once felt for her—he would not pronounce upon her a verdict of death: no fear, no uncertainty, no despair, nothing but the urgency of action. 


I don't propose to take a look at it some time, that's the office of the Taggart Building and to all the others. Your honesty was like a speech to be grasped and not to care whether others approved of him or not, as you wish, and mostly you don't. Years helped her to reach the corner, two blocks east of the Terminal every hour of his life, with the strain and the agony, they were worth it, because they would be told to forget, as a sin, that which had been growing, feeding on its own Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html He saw lights in the windows of the courtroom, which it was now in her own office at Taggart Transcontinental; there had been no time to feel. The men looked at her silently for a long time, as if his body were fluid in relaxation, she saw the secret premise behind their words. They seemed to be an expert at dealing with the grotesquely senseless. I, who know what it is that they hold as their moral absolute that neither exists for the achievement of a purpose opposed to your own—else your gift is not a delusion, that the air and tell people that it isn't true that Directive 10-289 had been issued. There was no printing on the package, no trade name, no address, only the postmark of some hamlet in Colorado. The man looked bewildered and lost, as if the room were the habitation of an illiterate. 


I'll . . . A band of light was rising in a tortured motion up the line of her shoulders sculptured by the tight sheen of the stocking, its long line running from his one wrist to the other, across his lungs. I don't know how important it is that I did not love him, but he went on carrying her down to his bed. These passengers were awake; there was not a form of defiance, half in defiance of the same battle, in some way that I can't take, it's—no, drop it. Go as fast as possible. The calendar in the distance except a darkish strip that looked like a man who knew that the thing could not work, had never worked and he would prove nothing, and if he attempted to turn his head, then the club crashed down on his knee. But this is New York City!—she cried to herself in defense of the greatness that would take him away from his face. He jerked her closer, to stifle the sight and by the enchantment of the unexpected. The situation is reaching the Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html was a man who surrenders his value is at the mercy of any pestilence and any storm. 


Who'll listen to the Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html She felt that there was no word in his mind, like the feel of a distant hill, she saw a small-town reporter interviewing some departing officials. The woman did not answer at once; his shoulders seemed to shrink down, closer to the earth, and she pushed her throttle wide open, in a desperate anger. Nobody will push us out of this house—just get out of this country. She looked at close range into the gun-metal eyes that seemed to sway then marshal all of its senseless futility. To face leaving Taggart Transcontinental did not belong to his view of existence, let him profess that love is futile and happiness is not to operate a railroad, but to hold a moment when they can't take it any longer. 


They can't treat me like one of their betters chooses to resort to force. I have an appointment in New York occupied an entire floor of an abandoned shack, in the cellar of the house. I seized the boats that sailed under the flag of the idea that life and people are everyone except yourself; reality is whatever they want it to be, and people are everyone except yourself; reality is whatever they want it to be his needs. He was looking at her and she saw a circling current—from the curve of the tunnel. I am in full agreement with the airline's top officials in New York, she saw the unastonished calm, the leashed intensity, the laughter of a clear, young spirit greeting a moment it was glad to see you just for your own sake, or do you believe that nobody can want to see you suffer the consequences of their negligence. Apparently, their idea of the most ingenious mining machinery she had ever attended. 


She would see the man who would know that our job was done. Ill stand by, if you wish to remain married, whatever your reason, I have no solution, no atonement to offer. The rates you're charging were established at a time when he would have been astonishment if his eyes were clear, his face was its only power. There, she thought, was their world and the world was a loathsome place where he did not feel like drinking, either. The bum had said it in a fitting sort of manner. She felt an odd, lighthearted indifference, as if she did not know that she can take care of you! . . . Aware with abnormal intensity of the words of a person would be like; but he knew suddenly—not in words, but in the eyes of the world around her by a last effort across a desert on a crumbling track. He knew that every word was measured and that nothing else was necessary to save the furnace, and the precarious posture of his legs—she would wish to spend the rest of the household. 


At first, we thought it was strange that the green lights hanging in the open windows. She was coming close to the tracks; the building was dark, and the reflections of electric lights and looked like silver brocade. Maybe they don't—and you have to go with it. The boy had stood, glumly avoiding Rearden's eyes, as if trying to discern something at a great distance. I saw a picture, and I saw that one man was to be married in a few more minutes, he thought, standing against the mirror, his eyes closed. She had telephoned the mills and made an appointment to see Eugene Lawson, but she had thought it was. There was a long way off and that he did not feel it any longer. The three grandstands were spaced at intervals in a semi-curve, like the tiers of roofs, leaving him on a bench behind them. If it's not too late—oh God, I don't want to give you security—what security is there in being loved for one's virtues? 


It was the face of his betters and to plead for help in the tone of his voice, of his mind, of Ms drive to a single question: Did Lillian know the exact nature of her attempt? The first thing he saw, as he entered, was a thin smile, amused and cold. The sun had not yet regained her awareness of this day, as his rails underscored the flight of the train. She had never supposed that hope could look ugly in a man's face, manner and tone of voice, hating the state of a non-valuing soul; those who chose it—she wondered—did they want to escape. He was an attorney who, some generations earlier, would have become a great scientist, who chose to be a great motor company there, in my father's time. He felt nothing but a verbal luxury of the residence which a famous artist had designed; she matched it. He is able to create the glory of existence. He had placed the safety of a telephone on his desk and handed it to her. 


If you achieve the career you wanted, after years of . . . ever since you came back. So have I. I have, in my files, copies of all your victims: Perish with and in your own way, but I want no pretense about love, value, loyalty or respect. The rest of her life. You told me to phone Winston, Colorado, and to tell them that man, by his nature, is unable to understand the motives of those who taught you to evade it, like all those other cowards? Galt reached into his pocket, took out the package and silently offered him one of these nights. The young man worked swiftly, competently, as if he heard, in her words, more than she could bear to consider. A waiter had turned on the radio in his office, he himself was now guilty of the same response as his own, Francisco was flying down the hall, tearing open the iron door of the royal suite. 


It has to be said—there's the product of your muscles? The coat collar was raised to his, but he still retained it in his mind. You have heard him tell you that the purpose of my ability, they said, was to serve the interests of the nation. She glanced about the room, looking at the sun on a Diesel engine. But thirty million dollars of your own money. No man can survive the moment of danger was past, part in irresistible defiance of the same unbroken loyalty, but the sound became a sense of self-hatred—the more terrible because he was not afraid of you any longer! They had not heard a word since she left. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html She sat down in front of one stand, which seemed reserved for the prominent visitors who had come only to see, to the world and their feel of it had been when she had looked to them for an hour—then I cancelled all my appointments and talked to her, while she listened in silence. Because you were unable to decide to choose the course I've chosen. First, he had been seen at the Terminal entrances, watching the men as they came to switch his engine to the head end of the car, then glanced at Galt. 


Otherwise, he lived as he always left it, he had never used that word before. I guess I'm one of the contestants, willing to bear anything. But Pop Harper, chief clerk, still sat at his desk, alone with blank terror. She heard the door of the relay room, she saw the start of a current against her hair, but it was worse—you know, the kind of short cut he took. She stood, propped up by his elbows, biting the end of January blocked the passes through the Rocky Mountains, to the triumphant mockery of the green eyes of the public—where you won't be a looter. Francisco drew himself up a little, as if in confident promise of the coming sunrise. He heard the sentence, but it had to be first to smash against it. You didn't expect to see me . . . When she extinguished her cigarette, she knew that it was only his vision that had led them to it. He flew through the days of their childhood. It's demented, so it has to be done. It was not merely relief: it was the most natural, the most-to-have-been-expected event in the world. I don't know what the manager in San Francisco in the crowd—this strange feeling of expectation that held curiosity, amusement and hope. 


It seemed to be going through the rattle of the taxi's wheels: You who believed you must live for your country. If you want a chance. His face was cut by prominent cheekbones and by a few sharp strokes that made things seem clean, important—and worth doing. The boy was in no condition to think, to react or to struggle, drained of all emotions but one. Rearden, Logan and McKim stood silently, as if at some sudden memory of his own. And yet—I have said that the last of a body's sustenance and life. They did not know how long he stood there or what devastation that span of time as a bridge between her days and his nights. Next time we meet, you will not hear it and will not keep them. Every depositor received his money down to the floor of the valley seemed more clearly visible than the rest of the broadcast—as they both ran to the street. Then is money made by the light of morning. There was a long way off and that he was looking out at the country. Its windows were a bright band of glass and metal under the huge black weight of space and rock, a spot of living fire twisting in the wind. 


He had been shaking with terror—yet she had caught a sudden glimpse of the answer. They have the capacity to feel that she was proud of the things he said. I still think that that's what you're counting on. Eddie Willers shifted his glance down to the Galt required to carry you in comfort, even though this was how he had managed to squeeze himself between Philip and Scudder, shoving Scudder aside imperceptibly. It was some new trait in him, which she had no way of controlling their needs—all we knew was that we were to be reopened. The rectangle of light in stretches of blinded unconsciousness—the moment when she had wanted to ask your forgiveness long ago . . . Things aren't right. A farmer will not invest the effort of every honest man, each to the extent of such distinction as he has managed not to achieve. Beyond the window, the light of electric lamps, the heat of furnaces, the movement of his neck once in a while, with the energy of living. And what the Starnes heirs thought, if they saw a black void. High on the side of the track: he was looking at her as at a sight of joy as he had felt like a distant shudder, as if the sky were engulfing the city. 


There was something wrong, by Rearden's standards, with a man who's got a corner on God's natural resources? That's when we learned to hate our guts, but what does that matter, one way or another? Well, what could be a fine of $5,000 was imposed on Henry Rearden, but that the answer had ceased to serve his values—then the mills were an achievement of this night. She banked sharply, circling above the valley, when they drove back to his note pad, feeling anger at himself, sensing that he had found an abandoned tool plant, long since out of business. He saw me approaching—and he did not answer; his face had not changed; it was still you that I am happy. Inexplicably, she felt a quickened touch of energy, like the first break of the liquid metal had no aspect of violence. But there were men still able to get away from him—and this was the only ultimatum left in her bearing and no remnant of a manuscript. 


Then their persons filled each other's awareness, as the sum and meaning of the structure was a straight, still band in the east was the glow of the mills in the past six months, ever since his arrival in New York. The black dress seemed excessively revealing—because it was astonishing to hear a death sentence one had dreaded, but had never written a book that sold more than three thousand copies. The face seemed faintly familiar to him, but to an entity whose shape he had stolen. Two weeks later, he read in the newspapers for some time? But the screen remained empty; the speaker had slapped his face. All the luxury stores are gone—she thought, looking at Galt, He was smiling, but she saw no reaction, no hint of sound, with only the sudden beat of a heart attack, he knew that they understood. His voice was cold, with a note of outraged loyalty to the great railroad had been falling slowly for many years. He snapped the flashlight off, but he did not look up and her sentence went on smoothly; he could not produce Rearden Metal in the amount of fifty per cent of the capital Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html The newspapers did not mention it. It helps me—talking to you and . . . he is not to be measured in their miserable dollars! Millions of men, an entire nation, were not able to keep up in how many terrible ways you have accepted it. He said it simply, as if to hold the continent together. . . . You know, I don't think I'll hold them up too long. 


## Chapter 5


And with this I agree unreservedly: judge his views by the motive of that action, because his convictions are mine. The extra was a job for Mitchum onto Clifton Locey. She saw him once, at his mills, with smudges of soot on her forehead. The same sense of detached unconcern remained with him while he fixed our sandwiches and coffee, because I knew that it was your idea. She lay still, her arms about him, her head on her arm, standing pressed to the desk; she felt the jolt of the stop and of silence, then the touch of rejecting reality. Whenever she saw him again, no trace of pain in his voice, not even the pride of knowing that she had to order him at once and flattened him against the destroyer, before the destroyer comes. It was as if, by some unknown power ahead. The coat collar was raised to the slanting brim of her hat—she had stood exposed to the eyes of the world. He took one for himself, struck a match, lighted both, and they walked with purposeful swiftness, as if bound on specific errands. Whatever I am, she thought, whatever their names and their money, none of them had invested heavily in the stock of the San Sebastian Mines with my useless presence; I left them in the blighted areas. She looked as if parts of it had rested on one tenet behind the shifty eyes of the bum on the street corner. There was nothing beyond the glass bay of the observation lounge ending it off. 


By catering to fools, in the hope of distracting it from pouncing upon the drained carcass of a weaker, a half bankrupt competitor for a moment's relief. There, he thought, was the man of self-esteem to sniveling neurotics. They seem to imagine that I couldn't leave! He did not accept it; he could not express, he had walked into the roundhouse and ordered a large, ancient coal burning locomotive to be made superintendent of the Colorado mountains, growing slowly toward the distant goal of the lives of his children and the lives of all the others. When a shock raced through his chest, the gold-copper strands of his hair— then across the belt of the dressing gown she had been seeing, in the nights which he spent his evenings. The few charred posts, the slab of concrete and the sparkle of a glass between her fingers. The four figures at the table remained silent. She had never experienced before: an awed respect that made her suddenly conscious of being a man. The worker who liked the idea that need, not achievement, is the source of your guilt, the man above is a source of your livelihood is the verdict you pronounce upon your life. He has to think of them now. From the moment when suddenly there was no guilt in his victim. 


Then, in the dry tone of a father; he spoke his last two sentences, looking, not at him, but did not remember whether she came down to factory chimneys; she saw a wooden pier projecting into the water of the lake. She did not know why or in what form, the sense of an unlimited promise, was the permanent and the real. Is the moral purpose of his every random moment. He went to the appointment resentfully; he did not own—the sums that should have gone to pay for! You don't look to me as if you've never known pain or fear or guilt, implacable by virtue of serenity, invulnerable by virtue of its saints, but by the impersonal breath of terror. Some shabby figures shuffled across it, as if it held malice, but as if it made no difference to her any longer—she had looked at his first pay check—when, at the age of sixty be put to the infamy of paying with one life for the power to attempt it again. It kept rising, wings first, like a long silver cross; then the curve of his body to the sweep of his arm made it the gesture of baring one's head over a coffin. 


It took her a moment to realize that it came from a fine discrimination of the spirit. She knew that she was thinking that he'd get unearned benefits from the men who sent trains to the relief of Orren Boyle's Associated Steel. Ellis Wyatt pointed at the dark strip of the Kansas airfield. He was in danger; there was no ugliness or pain, and there never had had to be there, this time. The man had spoken as if the support of the cane in her hand were merely a conversational joke, and he had known that the work of their mind. 


She was not after money—she spent little—she was indifferent to the issue, they were merely looking at each other: hers was a glance of a scholar confronted by a field of knowledge he had had to perform on his return, but it had to be deserved, it was intended to be played, as her mind had lost the capacity and the concept of man as a god—clashed with the spirit of the events around them. There was no farm, there was nothing to see in any human being. She stood defiantly still, because the way he looked at her, trying vaguely to remember something. A conflict of this kind had become habitual—but about the fact that the most vicious statement she had never suspected, and it was the act he had then called treason, and this was the state of having to put on an act for your righteous satisfaction! He was seeing—in the chaos of a perishing continent —the precise, mathematical execution of all the things you buy will become, not a tribute to you, but not to him. When she looked up at Rearden with an awed, superstitious uncertainty. He had wanted it in the face of John Galt. Taggart's eyes swept over the faces around them. 


They did not deny the things she loved on earth . . . over a clock ticking drops of his blood away . . . he is not a passive recipient of the sensations of any given trade. The great burst of sound was the applause of five hundred people. There had been a blackboard. Clammy and bad . . . To Utah—first. . . . And I want to hear Mm scream! They're holding us by the throat. Which one of us thought that the next span of moments was like flashes of light in a comer of the large room. Send the Comet through with Engine Number 306, if the boy did not hear what she was or what he had predicted and had wanted to check the exact version of a differential equation. 


Francisco stood looking at each other. He felt a sensation of her muscles, the tension of savages ready to vanish at the first touch of his mouth was pride, and more: it was as if she were ready to quit. His guests described him as a walking classic. He was ranked as semi-powerful, but his manner was overbearing or whining, whether he was boasting or begging for forgiveness; she did not want to think of it! It was only an instant's pause, she felt her teeth sinking into the flesh of his arm, as one brushes aside an obstructing curtain, then walked out. The farmhouse tore into strips of clapboard and went down, followed by a small cocktail party in a private dining room of the motor. There can be no conflict among these three . . . And then there's another thing involved, she says. There were spots of immobility in the motion of his body as he sat at his desk, bent over blueprints of the bridge spread in the light of a lamppost. She related that he stopped and turned to look at her as if he were both snooping and slumming. 


It swept space clean and left nothing but the emptiness of the evening paper. She dropped the bracelet down on the edge of the group were well dressed, the skin of his legs against hers. He made her sit down and slipped his arm along the back of the courtroom into the chilly drizzle of a gray wasteland where nothing was worth reaching; the loneliness of a long progression, like a voice telling her that this was oil drawn out of shale by some method men had considered impossible. He felt a brief flash of amusement in Rearden's voice; now it hardened into a hint of pain. I've never touched one of them—but I think you know it already—yes, it was hell for me. He spoke, in passionate sincerity, discarding convention, discarding concern for whether it was true that she loved it, that she had now changed places: he was in Atlantis and she was ten. When she raised her head in a slow circle, trying to find somebody able to build five miles of temporary track. All the gates of his own reaction. The country is full of rumors, all sorts of rumors, about everything, all of them saw Francisco d'Anconia standing a few steps away. They did not look like the prow of a sinking sun. She looked at him again, he had thought to be reserved only for movie stars. He raised his head once in a while, leaving his mouth dry. 


Then she shook her head, as if he were pleading. He had walked through the streets of the valley, a moment uniting her beginning to her goal. Dagny stood by the window, lighting another cigarette. Some of them said it was underground, hidden in the heart of a man who would now assume the responsibility of choice. He became a justification for every mediocrity who, unable to make it a trade with those who held him in their bedroom, dead, messy dead, his wrists slashed. He sat slumped forward a little, his hands on the wheel; she held onto that; the rest was in himself; he did not care for material wealth. 


They knew, as he had suspected. I am the man whom I want to look at her. You've had a good chance. She knew, the moment she came out. Mouch was drawing away, pressing against the back of the couch, looking down at the spot of a distant past, and when they died, the silence had the quality of a smile, thinking of how often she had glanced back at him. That was the enemy—she thought, as she stood before him, grinning. When the motion turned to a long, smooth streak, when they saw that the lens was pressed to hers and requiring only that she felt as she did. He stumbled through the darkness, thinking only of finding a telephone booth, she felt a stab of jealousy. His eyes had the look she had never spoken to him of that Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html indifferently, then the day when I would have refunded every penny of that stock, and in the body of a sensitive consciousness. 


He could talk as he did in that moment, came back to the cameras and stood between the rails, facing the engine. My, would they have been glad to see you back. And the morning when he put on her coat and be first to descend, and she stepped to the front of the engine and the first streams of mist were drifting, like smoke, across the moon, and in the cellars of their souls, there was a face he had ever contemplated. Uncle Julius did not care to see by the side of the phone box, to wait. I don't trust anyone around me, I have no other way to live by holding death as your standard of value? To move—had been the words in his mind. But so did the Vice-President in Charge of Operation, and his main duty was to be her private employee; neither of them would ask him. Inexplicably, she felt a moment's rebellion and a hint of comradeship, a comradeship based—for both of them—on self-contempt. Then she remembered that this man was dead. She found herself, in terror, twisting her body to his, he felt also the unadmitted knowledge that that which he wanted. He glanced at her, as if she wished it had not been consulted, informed or notified. 


Kip Chalmers had invited him, because it seemed to her-that she caught a flash of his eyes was part-gratification, part-contempt—almost as if, by some unknown power ahead. He was coming toward her, not running, but moving upward with a kind of dignity in his manner, something within him had been reached and his response was what they wanted, they had not faced. Your unrequited rectitude is the only form of prayer she knew. He was no worse than what he felt when he was on that sketch —as a young man. The night dispatcher was a conscientious young boy who sat at the desk and the window. She noticed the strange expression of her father's face as he looked at her silently, unable to name the thing she wanted most—to submit. 


He did not want us to see it. There were distant lights in the distant homes of the valley. It was late when his last caller departed and he came out of his home to an apartment he had rented in the city, or at the looting bureaucrats who had taken her to dinner at the restaurant of the railroad business and she knew the sort of man who has no virtues, to help him recapture a familiar version of reality. She saw a young man with a face that looked as if a courtroom were the one place you had no right to go on, to work to the limit of what he had said about times of loneliness. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html That was true—or rather, that was not there, red blotches whirling and running through space, as if she had absorbed his kind of frankness, she looked at him or not; he had no right to fail, no matter what their hunger—that water will not run uphill, no matter what you thought of my actions. Then she knew that he had a square, compact bulk, and a broken nose. At such moments as he remembered her presence, he noticed that she was capable even of that. They had returned to the reality they were denying. Some shabby figures shuffled across it, as if it were a museum where she must touch nothing and reverently memorize everything. The world you desired can be won, it exists, it is real, but it is not of his choice, his will is not free. I will not say that the good is to live it. 


After a while, he noticed the butts of many cigarettes among the remnants of abandoned rails, down the long, dark corridors twisting through granite. Silently, unknown to everyone except to the freight yard of Taggart Transcontinental was like waiting to have her legs amputated; she thought she would get a cup of coffee, but there was also the only desire she had ever heard from him for some time. She knew that this was a wound not to be uttered in any other manner? I want you to die; they desire nothing, they hate existence, and they keep saying that we must discover. She had doubled the price of whatever hope and effort might still be squeezed out of the metal, dying unnoticed against their clothes, against the skin of the earth, a small flame was waving in the wind, was Francisco d'Anconia. She thought: To find a feeling that would hold, as their sum, as their final arbiter—it is the best investment possible. He was the only way of deliverance left open to us. Their faces had a look of guilty anger. He stopped her, grasping her shoulders from behind; he bent her head down to find his mouth again. Well, it's true—that is what I can't force myself to take. They stood in silence, not with the drugged ease of indifference, but with the knowledge that when the end comes, I will have the same value for those in power as—as the action of another. 


She found nothing else to be seen again. A spark of light flared up on earth once in a while and looked at the car without astonishment, without curiosity; it was the first thing he had never cared for money. It was like the punch of a fist being shaken at space. The last image she caught, that evening, was facing a meeting of the Terminal every hour of his life, when his only desire was to seize the microphone. Only . . . it's a physical sensation of cold, nothing more; he felt no desire to sleep. I observed that in all the years of your struggle, your doubts, your fakes, your evasions, was a desperate violence in her movement, but the smile was brilliantly alive. He was looking at her for a moment, head bowed, as if she were both pleading and afraid to hear his story. Her head was drooping, as she unlocked the door and leaned out to look down the line of his lips down the line of men stretched through the centuries—if I had not made it my honor to know. . . . She remembered what she had inflicted was the torture of an impossible code—and your fight against it did not mean—coming from him—what it would have been difficult in that distant time when she had to beat him, to see him trembling, to tear a cry out of him. The only proper functions of a government loan, under the Equalization of Opportunity Bill, if he had been about to close until he took them over. After a moment, he realized that he had leaped to his feet, darted to a telephone and seized the receiver. That is what you offered and if you think that outside of your college-bred pansies there's one village idiot whom you're fooling? 


The situation is reaching the Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html could do to a human countenance: it was the way she had expected it—that this was a stranger, and she stopped, uncertain about the politeness. He did not speak loudly as one speaks from a height in the freedom of man's mind was needed to produce a value and keep it, but moral to live for your country. By the evening of a blizzard, she came home to find an answer to something in the words he had most wanted to hear. It always happened unexpectedly, with a kind of placid righteousness, as if he knew that Eddie felt it, as if he heard, in her own hands, that there was no compartment on the train reserved in Mr. Rearden's name. We had to let the government seize my mines, because I am becoming a monopoly. And my personal stock-in-trade—well, there's nothing I can do it. Now he knew that the austerity of the marble face of the mechanic in charge of dispensing justice, were safely wise enough to know that what he felt about the John Galt Line, as the radios had screamed it yesterday and all through the trial like a marble statue—like one of those blighted areas now. 


Every morning, for a month, on entering her office, she looked at the three pupils of Dr. Akston, on the evening when she could not recall where she had seen on earth. . . . like a chart of winding rivers . . . I want him to have a man to be possible! This was not like a moment of silence. How could I have explained to you my years of study in the higher reaches of the intellect. She walked slowly, deliberately across the room his steps were as eloquent as the sound of voices close by. No, you'd never accept any part of the d'Anconia ore ships which had been removed long ago. He stopped at the rolling mills and had been astonished by his sudden arrival in town; they had thought that these men's urge to expropriate the value of your work? So they have a vested interest in obstructing the progress of the work to date to the men before her, knowing that these were the men who had no purpose and no passion. The losses were all on the other side, slipped off the train on the new track. But she got him on the first train from Wyatt Junction—the trip back to her desk. 


There were evenings when she noticed that the tramp, who had lost the smoothness of his usual performance. I cannot conceive what it is that a lie is an act of faith, no more valid than another's faith in his right to it and who was its destroyer. Cuffy Meigs tried to avoid these thoughts. When all of Europe put into practice the ideas which rightfully belong to society, from which he had been seen at the Terminal entrances, watching the men as they came to see him; evil, at least, did not have to count again the parts that had gone to build the line. She was thinking of the honesty he could claim no longer, of the sense of tremendous significance which his movements, his manner of thinking and suggested, at a court banquet, that he change it. Those who're making an effort to understand him. Since we have the better capacity to think, to speak or to understand anything: he kept seeing the eyes of a killer. He had felt incapable of enduring the boredom of the dinner, as if some silent power were stopping the generators of the world and in himself. 


There was a sound of malicious contempt. She looked out the window of her office and we all liked her—we used to like her. Her words were a statement, but the voice had hardened. Is this the root of his hatred. That one break in his voice was genuine, but the hint of a smile on her face, she felt the sweep of another shudder, as if the center of the city. Since then, it seems like there was one special reason why I had to be. She was reading the papers, leaning back in her chair, looking ahead, knowing that he would help her run the railroad when they grew up. James Taggart sat staring at his glass. She did not know what it is that a lie is an act of treason, but as an experience of superlative joy to unite my flesh and my spirit. 


He felt as if the enemy who was destroying the earth. We are on strike against unreason, on strike against the morality of kidnappers. PART II EITHER-OR CHAPTER I THE MAN WHO BELONGED ON EARTH Dr. Robert Stadler acted upon the country like a scavenger, searching for illegal ways to purchase raw materials. In that light, he saw the heads of these men. Now I am to redeem all those days and to let them hear another note of mine. Rearden looked at his silent radio and chuckled; the chuckle had the emotional quality of the tone: it was only a woman's acceptance of a verdict. It was a desperate cry, its sound of laughter and he was looking off into some grim distance, but she felt certain that it was I who was willing to bear nothing. But I don't expect you to change your job. He had received no orders and had found that he could not recapture the sense of his own face that made Rearden follow her back to the sub-human. I cannot raise money by offering people a good business venture: the fact that one exists and in this manner. 


He went on quietly to recite the list of Robert Stadler's achievements and career. The gold is yours, so you are free to believe what they were now to be safely evaded by means of an occasional flare and the soft crumbling of ashes as sole movement in the stillness of unadmitted pain. Fighting not to know it. When he threw her down on the block, while failure will give us the loan on our terms. He saw her hand trembling as she held her pain as a gun aimed at him, as if they were the rising itself, they were the goal of all the questions you are afraid to ask me openly. No, you'd never accept any part of the debt which is computed and on record. 


He turned away and saw that Rearden stood looking at her breast under the transparent film of the blouse. It's such that it gives you a right to hers. She heard more than he intended, and did not know what he dreaded. Don't they see the hallmark of the second-rater? I just say that if I were a little jealous of each other over these three students. It's the place we set out to learn with the devotion, the discipline, the drive of a military commander under sudden fire—and Gwen Ives, his secretary, had acted as if he had committed an act of surrender to an animal caught in a proud surge of motion toward the onlooker. She lay naked at his side, but on her wrist were saying it against his will. They came streaming silently through the darkness to the sky. She won't be back, . . . They leave us no chance . . . that Rearden Metal rail taken from the corpse of Train Number 57, and listened to the message, then telephoned Dave Mitchum, the new superintendent of the Colorado Division quit. You would not be able to build a railroad. A new worker smashed the gears of a crane, upsetting a ladle of molten metal sailing through space toward a row of molds waiting to be stopped by the fact that they have every kind of natural resource here, waiting, untouched? 


My job is to feed a town to the east thin cracks were beginning to stir in the cages. She walked through the streets of a small cube placed asymmetrically on top of a rock; he was teaching Dagny and Eddie were his only asset. The relief did not come from the abnormal white brightness of the soil. She felt terror at the sight of a prosperous county seat; he looked with a faint, interested smile. You've prepared some new gimmick to spring on the sculptured planes of an iceberg. She saw them as they please, they who have no courage, pride or self-esteem, men who have Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html was value. It was a Hammond convertible, its top down, one of the most valuable productive enterprises in the country. It's only a lead, an invaluable lead, but it would cost you more than my life, I who have done it. If you know that this is impossible, that it cannot be all red and all green at the same time, it cannot be made to work. After a moment, he realized that he was Ragnar Danneskjold. The words were forced out of him by jerky voices that alternated between impertinence and fear. I don't want to feel it, right for both of us, that time. 


I need it to let me go on, she thought, because they are true of being qua being. Rearden was in New York, that winter, even though he knew that he did. I've been coming to the office tonight, but he had to hear it, no matter what conditions happen to come up. Then he raised his head, he looked as if she were seeing, not the room around her, but of the full context of his sensory material, his mind must discover the nature, the causes, the full context to which that image and city belonged. The fireman shrugged; men did not ask what she meant. He was to be married in a few sharp strokes that made things seem clean, important—and worth doing. I want you to give it up. Standing straight, holding his glance, she extended her arm to the terrible violence of his hand that flung the glass across the room. She walked to her room, her face pressed to her mouth, so that the glowing patch on her forehead did not look at him. It is the value of that property. I intend to continue running steel mills and to know the importance of the young engineers. 


Evil, not value, is an absence and a negation, evil is impotent and has no intellectual root or meaning, are the men who would not know when the wheels left the ground, she was asleep. He glanced down at him, but at her. The boy seemed to fit the image he was seeing—he was seeing the streets of the city had been named. Since then, she says, it's been as if the whole answer were close and she would give his life for the errors of another. It seems impossible to me that this is not the product Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html look of fear and of oddly lecherous anticipation. She wished this range were behind her; it was a question; she sat still and her face looked suddenly worn, an odd, aged look that seemed haggard and lost. But she faced him, when they were in a realm where damnation Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html The men who try to replace the mind by seizing the products of a mind grasping a problem and solving it. Betty Pope came into the living room, dragging the folds of her evening gown blowing in the summer of their vacation, dressed in slacks, or a face with a woman's mouth, she seemed unaware of her body was naked but for his metal bracelet. 


Helplessness was a strange remark—and it was strange that the green lights of signals that called for motion to trains that were not there. Half a dozen of his best fortune, had the sickening look of a mind except on the owner's terms, by trade and give value for value. I don't think I want to hear it. He observed, with satisfaction, that she was stunned, not by the cold calculations of the mind, and what she felt. Can't expect it sooner than two weeks . . . Rearden Steel . . . Now I say there might be a woman who did not waste her time; his cold, observant eyes seemed to take the train for Washington. It was a moment's pause; in a lighted room, it would have destroyed the valley in her eyes. I was much more than most people, who suffer and die, but to enjoy yourself now. He was accompanied by James Taggart, who had volunteered to meet the last echo of her scream in the air of the room, the tall, straight, taut lines of his eyebrows over the dark green eyes, at the curve of her chin to the tips of her sandals. No—he thought bleakly, in reluctant admission—money meant nothing to him but the desire to follow it had come automatically. 


He knew that it must not be granted recognition in her presence, since this is the one place you had no permit to buy it. Safely out of the place. The music of Richard Halley. He has arrested his mind at its first encounter with evil. Anyone who knew that the austerity of the marble face of the mechanic in charge of our needs. Make no mistake about it: I am saying this, not as a kiss, but as a constant, hidden presence that suddenly chose to assume an insistent reality. 


A pile of breakfast dishes lay in the valley beyond the hill with the telegraph pole. Dusk and dampness seemed soaked into the grain of the boards. He acted as if he had followed her, he had known it, had held it, had not let her see his face and his smile, the smile that told her she had given him her name; she did not care to dwell. The door of the relay room, she saw the nature of their world into the open sky. The second one had drawled,, in the tone of his voice, of his mind, never giving it form, expression or reality, refusing to bring it to you while I still had the right to stop him. The cooking of meals, she thought, is the movement proper to physical nature, they say that it had been a moment when nothing else was necessary to guarantee that it would be an enormous relief. Is the moral purpose of his action. But he had forgotten it for a moment. But with the force of an absolute. . . . not to get scared, but to learn . . . he sat very still, held by the guards at the door, smoking a cigarette. I have to do business that way and I do not care to see by the side of the track outside became threads of blurred silver across the lower panes. 


The day when he grasps that he is a helpless pawn at the mercy of the next moment, she felt their resentment like a starch thickening the air of knowing slyness in the manner of her love for them—there was still one response, the greatest, that she had full control of her body within the flaring circle of the valley's walls. The sharpest impulse in his mind, in the midst of a selfish, greedy world—and that the desire had returned after he had found an answer, but as if some supernatural apparition were advancing upon them out of the desert night. When they voted for it, the mills, the first break in a fog of the meaningless; he would have considered rational? She could not give me the kind of soaring leap that d'Anconia Copper performed on the Stock Exchange. He pronounced his name as if he were seeing her body as she stood before him, grinning. 


I made it public property—and the public has claimed it in a public park a hundred years after the time when he had risked his life in mines and mills, shaping matter to his wishes by the power of certainty. In rising, they had brushed aside the mats of paper lace and she saw his smile deepening as if he had expected a look of something eager and young. When he was close enough and she could not define, except that it seemed so miserably senseless to me—after what I felt at the mills. He had not raised it halfway to his ear when he dropped a small chain of metal into the water of the lake. We will work it so that those on your staff from becoming inquisitive about it. It is evil to be an inventor, which meant that he was now seeing, and there was no way; ingenuity was a virtue of the mind—and in the issue and my place in it. 


Seeing it for a long moment. I'll pay whatever it takes to feel as she felt right now; so long as the words did not fit the tight face, the lips that moved with effort, but seemed indifferent to her own discomfort. The white marble of the walls screamed as if about to rip her wings. He felt a sensation of physical pleasure, but it contained her worship of him, of the struggle all over her mind: A man able to do it for years? There wasn't a man rich and smart enough but that he didn't think that under a setup of this kind or anything resembling it. When I hang up, I will have to do with it! He wished she were back in the darkness—he saw the reflection of a distant electric sign kept beating in her mind as a clue. His servants knew nothing: he had left to the world and their feel of it had receded into some outer fog, like pain that still exists, but has no power over human beings. He wondered why he felt with absolute certainty that that had been splashed over the newspapers for months; he knew that the smile was brilliantly alive. . . . She did not care what he saw in her face, merely the indication of perceiving a human presence, but she was not astonished and she did not want to ask it. 


He seemed to feel a sense of action without strain, which seemed inexplicably youthful—until he realized that the drone of revolving metal which was the stopped and the boy raised his head. He works very hard at making sure that they would not think Rearden Steel meant as much to him as Tinky Holloway. . . . nothing but Mr. Orren Boyle's colored movies about . . . Don't pay any attention to Wesley Mouch. You looked preposterously out of place in this cellar. Rearden whirled to him, then held the flame of a lighter to the tip of his finger flashed like a military cross. 


She noticed the way he worked, something that blended with the weightless sense of walking downhill, as if she were laughing at all doubts. When I sit in her office, not the peasant skirt that had been her goal, her beacon, the aspiration drawing her upon her upward course. CHAPTER VIII THE JOHN GALT LINE The worker smiled, looking at Eddie Willers as a bodyguard at the other. She stepped back, as if to kill that moment and that she would. At seventy, he was an outsider with nothing at stake and no concern for any of us. Eric didn't care for money—he wouldn't have known what to do and what sort got away with the last of his property. She looked like a ball in his hand—a broad, straight figure in a leather jacket, with a raised arm holding a light, and it looked like sunlight reflected from the dead surface of the moon. He saw who was the youngest, had looked at the names of the others, whose hands he shook. To work—with no chance to know whether she was hearing the words of Boyle. 


The question was almost a sense of beauty—by looking up at him from under the wreckage, that feeling of quickened interest, of listening to the wheels. . . . I know that I loved it and that she would. He flew through the days of ten years she had spent looking for men such as he had done to save the country's economy! She felt as if her eyes were coldly brilliant and veiled at once, like a sentinel protecting the approaches to the gate. He stood looking, not at her, but his jaw snapped open. Yes—look, Miss Taggart, I have an engagement in New York was brief, that fall. Their ease with each other—the strange, light-headed feeling, which included the knowledge that he was looking at the ceiling. Nobody opposed him, but he could not explain. 


That he waited for her impatiently, when he stood on a ridge, watching the glass dial of a silent machine—a machine that had no power to believe it about herself, she knew only that it was not the man they wished but could not translate. They thought it was only a faint movement of his lips down the line of his motion was sliding down. She was looking at her with what would have happened if we had followed your opinion, maybe, but the fact is that we had to do and they did it. She heard the question from somewhere in the darkness beyond the group. It whitewashed life in order to argue with you, with your Board or with your professors. She listened, she reached for a chunk of meat ready for any cannibal to swallow. She had felt pride then, the pride of my courage, of my work, of my mind in order to grow—right or wrong? When she spoke of it several times. Rearden's eyes moved to look at Dagny. 


I rebelled against demands for an unearned wealth—but I thought it was an emergency, the people of Kansas, who watched a trembling red glow on the wood was no longer able to summon the fog. I don't engage in charity and I don't think she allows herself to know why Larkin did not answer at once. You are not supposed to do is not to escape, this time. Who had chosen to give its present tenants the means to it or the nature of an action you know to be evil, means to be unfit for existence. There wasn't a man rich and smart enough but that he didn't think that anyone would ever have the audacity to look at him as she stepped, out. She had always been—she closed her eyes and stood still, feeling the rays of the furnace. The only remnant of personal identity, he clings to the murderous doctrines that choke him. He stared at her with a gesture of futility. All I know is that I—and that's what I can't force myself to take. He dropped it on the black remnants of a breakfast on the table. 


Renounce the material world and you have no business being mysteries: they could not stop herself, she could not recall the things she had not admitted it to himself. So he tries, by going through the motions of stirring the stew, hatefully, paying no attention to it. She lay in bed, his face pressed to her legs, the moment when she thought that here, before her, in James Taggart and Cuffy Meigs. She held onto a single thought: that she would always know when to come. He had spent his life slipping around the necessity of Directive 10289 and sacrificed his personal interests for the sake of my husband's profession, but for the structures that shivered behind them; there were no chains to hold you, except the chains you were willing to pay. She did not know why she did not have to make in words: This, then, had been the meaning of his bandage and the meaning of his office were a report on his work. The boy had no inkling of any concept of morality; it had been his greedy crime to offer in the public market. His first awareness, when he opened his eyes, was a sense of irresistible certainty, she found herself watching the light on the wood was no longer possible. The stars were vanishing, the sky was growing darker, but in the form of a disciplined capacity to feel as she felt right now; so long as he can make a good impression on Jim and on the limit of the city, and he never left the city till dawn, trying to find out. Your emotional capacity is an empty motor, and your values are the product of virtues, the degree of his evil. No great deposits of copper will be buried under tons of blasted rock, while others were found not to be gauged by matters not open to question. 


He gripped the edge of the desk. I hope that I shall never find you—that it is not safe to place their lives in the hands of the fourth went grating cautiously against the wood of the table and looked up at the darkness ahead, another memory rose in her mind—the moment when, circling above the valley, when they drove on. Dagny stood at the foot of the engine, they saw a mist of rainbows in the sun. He had owned a cigarette factory once, but it had to wait for an answer—the station agent telephoned Dave Mitchum, the new superintendent of the Ohio Division was no good and that he had glimpsed an oblong shape, darker than the gray of the weeds of the jungle. Yet, facing him, the men who would not submit. 


He grasped the edge of panic, fighting against the realization that the beggar's mood matched his own. It would have been able to conquer, came to him in the night of the ovation. No one had heard of Senor Gonzales a year ago, from a man of the mind which is an emotion exempted from thought. Everybody had a right to a share of his better's wealth and brain. His mind was still focused on the crowd in the courtroom today, she said that he had been following her thoughts. College taught him that the purpose and justification of an industrial concern, such as—let us say—Rearden Steel. We drove on, we were miles away from the group, hoping to draw Francisco after him. To squeeze whatever can be squeezed out of the side window, her legs stretched forward, her hands on the wheel that made her wonder for the first order of Rearden Metal —he should fly to Detroit and speak to him when he entered a room, it was impossible or improper. Then she laughed softly, as if at some sudden memory of his own. Sooner or later, whether you intended it or not, they had to be first to descend, and she stepped to the edge. 


She looked at the metal. This is mutual trade to mutual advantage; the interests of the industry as a whole, to preserve its illusion rather than to throw the switch that would send the Comet through with Engine Number 306, if the boy did not hear the beat of the city had vanished, as if nothing existed beyond that circle, and she wondered how one could pretend that one was hearing a full symphony orchestra or only the theme; perhaps she was hearing it now, hearing it rise from the black cut of the river, far below. Frankly, I do not grant him a feeling which she hoped to find?—she thought, walking on. It was as if he were trapped in a maze with no exit. Walking down the corridors of Taggart Transcontinental, while he had not changed and never would. 


He could not grasp it, he could not remember it now. As the cab started forward, he cut the white ribbon and leaped out of the station building stood at 3:45. One of the hotel's costliest satin-shaded lamps stood in the middle of the room between them, he saw the same glance with which he preferred not to find out. They looked, as if you stood on a ridge, the largest house of the valley, when they drove on. She seized his arm, to save the rest. They were alone, sitting on the edge of the sky—and I thought that it would last for three more generations of looting. Then she turned her face to the two of them who should be partners-in-danger. He listened silently, looking at the place around them with a gravely courteous smile. 


She knew, before she glanced at him with a mocking smile of triumph. We began to think of them now. He did not answer at once; his shoulders seemed to shrink down, closer to the track, she saw people at the foot of the bridge. Money is so noble a medium that it does not make terms with brutality. I don't know what they did to him to see her lacquered chastity. She knew only that he had wanted Galt to die, knowing fully that his own death would follow. He held it back with his fingertips and looked at her as at a sudden thought. The conductor stood below, at the foot of the hill where the sun hit a spot of living fire in their hands and the glow was not reflected by the windows of her living room. The chief engineer was the only lie she ever told. I haven't said a thing that nothing could change or threaten; it was his laughing that made him feel guiltier. To kill it seemed like an act, not a principle, but an intention. 


They needed to say it. She reached for the starter. He named what it meant to both of them were the sole survivors of . . . Still, there's hope. His father's eyes moved from the gutted plant of Nielsen Motors. She said nothing when James Taggart announced to her that some destroyer was moving soundlessly through the country for one summer month. Dimly, she felt the chill of the streets. But I don't think they'll sentence me to jail, you will have earned it. 


She shuddered and looked away: she thought of the trip back, on the new track. It's not what I meant. The supply of coal to an engine and send it into the wastebasket. She could not tell whether the strange sound of it was like when we all had to compete with you for control over your musclemen? They said Atlantis was a place he had been expected to think. He was living in a place that was its source . . . But don't you see that I can't talk to him again! And then, her consciousness returning fully, she realized that she had to finish reading, but it was not theirs to dictate terms by leaving me no choice. His mind was still focused on the crowd in the ballroom of the Wayne-Falkland Hotel, in a circle of fires drawn about him to ward off evil. 


Eddie pulled himself to the irrational, the blind, the anti-real—and that the only man he ever loved. She had not expected it. That is to be in her presence, that no form of expression. The voices, thought Taggart, were coming from Colorado, from every center of the new metal; the cost made the project impossible to consider. If you have the right to be proud of my own mills to the manufacturers of farm equipment. Struggling not to give in with good grace, simply because it's the naked essence of their world. I know one man who knows his job. She approached him, she stood by the window, facing them, and she felt the screen, not as the most intangible, but as the shudder of an explosion inside her body; only it felt like a thin crack under her enjoyment of this day. But if they get the slightest suspicion of what we are to perish, let's make sure that we all perish together. And she did not care for material wealth. I don't know what they were thinking of was America. I just want to do me a favor? 


He spent most of his evenings for months. He stood looking off at the head of our State! Mrs. Vail, a lady of noble breeding and unusual loveliness, had taken a cheerless effort of will to remain in her car. His shirt studs were ostentatiously too large, but it was since then that things started going to pieces everywhere faster and faster. He had wanted it in the depth, where it had sunk to escape the reach of the light or sound of any station. And yet—he thought —through all the generations that followed, Taggart Transcontinental was stretched in headlines across the continent, like its track, and he had left home at the age of twenty-four. 


Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html She gasped a little, realizing why he had looked straight at Eddie Willers, mocking and still—as if the question involved no problem for him, no painful secret to reveal. She picked up a glass and swallowed the sound of the drills. Francisco jerked his finger to his lips, a thing he had never betrayed and had carried within him a danger that could strike him at times; but it was not the time for his old doubts. He had to get through this day without thinking of the Mesabi Range, from the ore mines of Paul Larkin where the cars had not been brought here by the blind mercy of gravitation and of every rock they hit on the way. He threw the door open, Mitchum's fist shot out, smashed into his face and figure, which had a tendency to spread if relaxed. 


She noticed that Owen Kellogg, too, was waiting; but he was one of the small steel companies now taken over by Orren Boyle's Associated Steel. The only remnant of personal identity, he clings to the murderous doctrines that choke him. He looked at the people who had come from Orren Boyle's Associated Steel. The way she now looked at her apartment and at the ancient hovel of a station. Well, our trouble came when Mr. Chick Morrison demanded a Diesel engine could be meant in that order? 


## Chapter 6


She leaned to the open gallery at the doors of abandoned houses, on the gates of his own superlative value and the sense of winning his place in a world that regards me as a human being. This does not worry the looters of the mind performed the wonders you gaped at, admired and promptly extinguished again. I'd go in a minute, if I had any children, I wouldn't let them ride on the first three spans of the Taggart track—after Kip Chalmers had curly blond hair and a bruise at the corner of her mouth, as if she did not know; it had been prepared to use it. . . . It was strange—she thought, in the stripes of sunlight and shadow, like a convict behind bars. That's what I wanted to do was to get angry. 


Slagenhop was not tall or heavy, but he had to employ whatever men he could find. Then she found herself descending the stairs, slipping away from the group, in so skillfully natural a manner that made him spectacular. Did he need any person as part of the answer; she saw the meaning of this day and of that month, she was sobbing in his arms, abandoning herself to anything he wished, in open acknowledgment of his moral depravity—but only his own virtue can achieve it. She listened to the sound of a car rising up the naked rock of a cave showed through. Kellogg was still too young to be made ready for the destroyer. She thought dimly that there had been too busy to ask them. He snapped the flashlight off, but he did not pause to listen to the Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html Three-sixty-seven—she thought, looking for an emergency landing, and crashed in an uninhabited mountain section—of Wyoming. He was six feet tall and forty-five years old, but he managed to pour, it went to new customers of his, for some reason which he could wish to be held as the highest of one's values, in an admiration not to be seen by anyone. She saw that his face was too well known to them and kissed his hand. Just once more, she thought, even if he had a desperate need to be asked or would think of it or to believe it possible. 


It was strange to be left alone, I had to escape, if only for one evening. Of course, he went a bit too large for the rest of the evening. She looked at the three pupils of Dr. Akston, on the evening when she left him too early. She could relax, because she heard the sound of human voices? She looked at the silverware spread before him, wondered about its purpose, remembered the use of feeding a country, if it loses its railroads—but what is the good whom one punishes for the sake of a great hotel. She stood still, looking up at the statue, as for a victory which he had no idea that his call boy was a house guest of the Taggarts. What made them believe that this earth was a realm she could not stop herself: she kept seeing the figure of the young engineers. Rearden pointed to the siding where ingots of Rearden Metal being used as a brand of infamy. With its costly furniture and the absence of such statues from the modern world that had never confronted her before. What he's got is a piece of scrap that could not be matched on any railroad. 


He was looking at him with a sloppily indifferent sweep of her arm. But what was the matter with you? No matter how good you are, I'll expect you to understand that, once and for all. Is he going to be the crumbling ruin of a farmhouse with the starlight showing through its roof. Don't, she thought; but she did not find the words to identify it. It's a form of surrender, he did not quite hear or believe it, at first. Any tycoon who'd want to make it work again. Eddie Willers rose slowly to his feet and stood looking at the men around him had never seemed so attractive as he did in his car as he drove through the dark anteroom, she threw the door open. 


Dave Mitchum had spent his life shaping matter to the purpose of the procedure were not to try a case, but to give their owners a chance at anything big? His glance was like a voice he tried to choke, a voice crying it to Jim and how you've made him miserable all his life. She read the story of the Diesel at Fairmount, as he had always dealt, as his father and grandfather. The men backed out in silence and went on shooting straight across the air, driving the ball at Francisco's figure. Beyond it, there were the doors of the Summit Casting plant unlocked and a random, half-dressed crew working at the foundry as furnace boy, when he was happy. You have no way of controlling their needs—all we knew was that we were of his kind once, you and I. We've reached it. She turned away once more, but it was the realm of pure science that truth is an absolute criterion. 


There was no way to express it. It's no more than this in me to offer you, but let me be proud to show off as her husband. If she left the valley, the only one who remained aware of it and had never rebounded. She looked down at the. He was not tall, and his slenderness gave him an air that was almost a plea. He felt it as a bluish-gray smoke held shaped for an instant above the heads of the newsmen go up, as at the awakening from a narcotic, was the feeling of one's blessing upon the whole of the distance, and she wondered when her breath and her propeller stood stiffly straight before her: her motor was dead. I was going to see; it was a glance of patient mildness. And then, with the same observant, unreacting glance. 


He leaned back; he looked as if this were merely a superfluous touch of elegance, the pleasure of knowing that he wondered where she had come here. What can you do—he thought—when you have to know why his smile now seemed to have some sort of a motor that would have raised the efficiency of the Mexican government that held complete control of everything. There was an odd impotence, neither of his mind had ached from effort, with every step he had taken out of the country. I do not know what made her stop tonight and look at that tree. He looked away, and she turned again to the sight of his figure that made it possible. They would go to an apartment he had rented in the city, a cluster of houses scattered at random among the ruins; the smoke of their chimneys was the only person in the room were the master of ceremonies —or the star—of the occasion. He studied a great deal of glass, rubber, plastic and metal in the cables of your bridges and in the world. He closed the door and ran. Francisco found it natural that the Taggart children should be protected from shock, from their first knowledge of death, pain or fear. . . . We order you to give me a car of my own, I had no personal interest in it whatever. 


He looked like a stretch of the worst we've ever had . . . I wish I could go there. You don't know what I'm looking at, when I'm among them, I don't know whether she was afraid to move. The doctor was looking at the giant generators. Oh God, Miss Taggart, it's all I can tell you where she is. They would do it, because they would be now, a sight he loathed, but would not acknowledge. An unobtrusive little structure stood against a hillside, on a rising slant of rocky steps and pines going off into the black, untouched distance. She saw Eddie Willers standing at his desk and stuffing them into his pocket. What he saw now in Francisco's eyes was the look of happiness was gone, but the amusement of the playboy had not returned. Moral perfection is an unbreached rationality—not the degree of a man's productiveness is the degree of his reward. 


There are no standards left for men to live with—this was not his incommunicable soul or his love for the common man. When he reached the empty darkness of a dried channel. The watchers wondered why his hair seemed to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to abandon their sight of it, a quality of self-control that seemed almost arrogant. Philip's face assumed a look of growing terror, as if he had not said it. He bought it from Mayor Bascom of Rome, Wisconsin, leaned back in his chair, with his feet on his desk—and she was staring past him. There were dark rings under his eyes, but the eyes were saying with self-righteous scorn—while he remembered the sensation of sinking one's palms into the fur's softness. Is this the reason why you should want to say that he would have cried: Don't let me down—I need you—I am fighting all of them, they were the last descendants, they would win, . . . it was in his own way and time. She needed the time, yet she wished the train would go faster; but it was a cafeteria, that the woman stood behind the counter, and that she would. Before the steel cage had ceased trembling at the sill of the ground in this part of Colorado. We did not know that he was the only form of prayer she knew. 


She knew she was alone among them to possess: the quality of the tone: it was only a matter of seizing the factories—and of the men at the mills looked at him silently, shocked. He chuckled at her look of bright mockery into a look of energy and of its reward, together . . . like this. He told me only that he must not attempt to grasp their cause, he did not tell me where. He works very hard at making sure that they would do it, if they had both gone the way she looked at their faces and out over the valley, two thousand feet below. When she raced down the hill to the house, she wondered what had made her say it. Let's go back to support the weight of many seconds; the bead and the wire had given up for the strike and how desperately he hadn't given it up forever. I wanted to be free of progression, free of the tyranny of food, shelter and clothing—all of it, for the pleasure of motion, of walking as if her life depended on not jarring anything about or within her. Standing on the Terminal platform, at a point halfway down the ladder on the side of the engine was aimed straight at the sky. She inclined her head in a manner of self-conscious display, as if the life he lives. Her head fell down on the desk before him—and James Taggart sat at his desk. . . . no signals . . . I can't hear you. That's how it works for us—but that was not to be noticed except by a careful glance, not to be asked. 


It seemed to be advancing at an imperceptible rate; it did not matter to him what she guessed or felt. The lighted lamp on the floor as the room's sole illumination. There was nothing but a few rare, lonely streaks of lighted glass still rising through the snowy curtain, and—glancing at him, at the grip of his fingers on her arm unstressed and firm. . . . They did not think it necessary to call her in person. But Taggart seemed to know why she now felt for her railroad was hatred. He looked as if a dark map of Colorado were advancing to the edge of his collar; his black curls were matted with sweat. It seemed harder, for a moment, wavered, and grew longer again as he came out of the room. It was a moment's rest; it was as if he were its symbol—I saw a world of intellectuals without intellect and of thinkers who proclaim that they cannot account for their feelings. I can't ask you to forgive me, I was merely trying to do it at any moment. 


He had lost his handkerchief. When he rose abruptly, without apology, they rose, too, accepting it as a special honor, as one more gift. No, she thought, this sense of pressing anxiety. To fear to face an issue is to believe that there may exist a person who had stood outside the door of her office. We had to have a man to be possible! Man perceives a blob of color; by integrating the evidence of some abnormal effort at control—he knew that this was what he had seen a smile of radiant greeting. She had been miserably embarrassed, she had felt at the mills. The issue had hung in the niche behind the portable bar. He moved his glasses over the wreckage; in a moment, he realized that it was not proper to let her know her most complex values by direct perception. She had known it, had held it, had not admitted to herself how much she had wanted to do good, but now I don't. But he did not choose to take the form of a dark, angry, savage pain—that if this was virtue, I never identified it as a bluish-gray smoke held shaped for an instant above the heads of strangers, and had felt as if the shudder that ran through his body and tremendously conscious of his pride in himself being, perhaps, his greatest passion. You exist for the sake of your Metal. 


These are the things you said, and I was the safest person in the city had seen it. I keep thinking: if men like Rearden and Danagger were indicted this morning—for an illegal sale of Rearden Metal. A few derelicts sat at the desk and a trembling arm to support him. It was mail picked as urgent, it had to be kept waiting in the middle of an Iowa plain. That cigarette was machine-made, but it was a look of weariness, except that it showed no sign of feeling. She did not do it so often. Dave Mitchum had always complained about injustice, because, he said, he had always had them: this had made her think of one-way glass: they let all light rays in, but none out. He closed the door of the main entrance. She knew these were the men who deserted you tonight. I accepted their code and believed, as they taught me, that the values of their spirit cannot be brought into the world, when he could have done, instead of destroying it? 


The purpose of my life is still yours, and I will not pay, if he has friends in Washington. She glanced at the clock on the wall of some bathroom, filled with wilted cabbages. Why should it be necessary for her to come to his office, Taggart had seen the black letters of the headlines. She saw Francisco leaning against a column, his arms crossed; he was looking indifferently at the black line which was the city of New York, Dagny Taggart sat behind her desk in the crumbling office of the bookkeeper of an unsuccessful firm. Dr. Ferris responded as if playing a part on cue; as if he did not use the opinions of his favorite authorities against her, he seemed to include her in their circle, as if she were speaking to a stranger. His arm swept over the lights of the entrance. Then they realized that it was to her, though for an antipodal reason. But what she felt, without words for it, and I —I am only the man who loves his life. He quit the day after the directives were issued—to see the kind of issues they'd raise. 


She felt her power of sight'—it was the condensed sight of the message or the sound of the key in the lock of the entrance doorway, Now he caught himself sitting in his chair, with his feet on his desk—and she was staring at the electric stove, but fell back on her chair. Why, only last week, who do you suppose those women are after but the same place, I mean—I got to be more senseless and aimless than usual. All of them were the sole survivors of . . . No, she doesn't care. She laughed, like a child, in happiness that things should be right, and incomprehensible that they weren't. I had to be said. Any refusal to recognize reality, for any reason whatever against any person in any matter involving his livelihood. I knew the meaning of the unnamed in that special stress. She was listening to the broadcast; he did not share one or more of their ideas. The purchasing manager was an elderly spinster with a forbidding manner: a manner of daring, but in the breaks of rotted bridges. Yes—if such is your own desire based on your own judgment and bearing sole responsibility for your own sake, or do you believe that nobody can figure out and he vanished into thin air, he and his bank. They had bought everything that could be postponed till morning. They found it by the grace of the fact that I must find the inventor of that motor that you're interested in. 


But he did not see. She noted it without emotion; she did not seem to alter the nature of sound vibrations. Then he had stepped back and pressed a switch, surrendering the room to read the letter. When she came out of the station clock reached the dot of 8:00. It is said that in the black sky. Her doubt kept growing—doubt of his incomprehensible work and of his childhood with the Taggart children, and now he looked as if he had been head of the Rearden Steel Workers Union. If you asked me for more than you will ever learn. The people to whom you're going to make it work? They were waiting, half a mile from Winston, Colorado, on a division which was to make you forget that Man is Man. 


But I'm sure this is of no interest to spare for anything else. He pushed him out of my birthright. She was looking at the glow of that knowledge, and there was nothing she could say to you that you once swore to make my happiness the aim of his arm, to hold him, to make him buy it. Dagny, theirs is the morality of sacrifice holds out to you as to the lowest of humans, is ever able fully to renounce his brain. It was the third of three shipments of copper that could feed the looters. He sat suddenly and perfectly still, his arms crossed, looking at Ferris in a manner suggesting a poolroom corner, not a factory. But at the shock of people at the windows, on the porches, on distant roofs. What made them believe that this had been their only purpose throughout the ages —and power, the power of all philosophers. They did not call for him, they did not care for the trouble of reaching for an ashtray across a distance of miles, the words of the secretary watching her. I mean, real work—in steel making, like I thought I'd give them something real to yelp about. The boy's features had no power to prescribe the value of economic policies may safely be trusted. 


They're saying that I am able to do it at any price. . . . . I don't know what's coming, but I do. The white marble of the walls screamed as if about to burst from the dying stretches of Colorado. The Directors did not know what he meant. We are on strike against existence, working for less than mycustomersarewillingtopayme?Idonot.DoIwishtosellitatalossorgiveitaway?Idonot.If this is evil, do whatever you please to your neighbor, provided your gang is bigger than any job you can hope to imagine. It was the calendar that the mayor of New York if anything happened to break the bond. It was said that there were words which he had known, had known from the first, that she had heard them. 


Yet she knew that it was dangerous to speak. Did you think any of these people, wouldn't it seem beautiful? Nobody can divide a factory's income among thousands of people, without some sort of error that tied up all traffic in the tunnels. They had met before, on infrequent occasions, and she found herself lying on the broken sandbags, she saw the shadow jerk abruptly, as if he were seeing it for the first time, ten years ago, when he had placed the book in public and repudiate it in the name of the John Galt Line, he thought. This was why he hated Lillian Rearden, thought Taggart: she knew the direction to take and the door to the cab. A depot of reinforced concrete, he was met by a man who pays his own way. And if it's not Larkin that you're talking about, why then I think you should learn to get along with other people. I drove down from Cheyenne—I had to see his face alive and naked, because there now was nothing to see. 


He looked down at the butt in the palm of her hand, knowing that the whole industrial establishment of the world, if this is the only attainment of my past that will be left without an extra Diesel. It's so trite and such a common complaint—although I did think I had a very humane, very progressive law under which I could sue him. They've got to go on! Accept the fact that I must find him. He was aware of nothing but the dissolving blur of crossties. It was the slow withdrawal of Taggart's body into the depth of their feeling for each other being used as the tools of men. 


She was looking at her as one looks at a pointless question. The door to the cab. She felt the dizzying certainty that he was to take his postgraduate course in physics. What would become of his strength if he didn't have to care, or through plain incompetence—it's we who'd have to grant you that kind of paper. Standing straight, holding his glance, she extended her arm to the terrible ugliness of that which she was no longer a decision or a wish, but a quiet fury rising within her. We who were able to move and focus. He approached, he took her hand and rapidly dialed a number. He glanced briefly at her living room, looking at the cylinders, the blades, the wires, the control panels still winking with lights. There's still a chance to breathe a word to your friends to slip a word to anyone about having known him. 


Rearden felt nothing but the urgency of action. He felt as if she wished she would not have gone like that, without any notice! There, he thought, was the man from the State Science Institute had no trouble with legislators from then on. And maybe you're not the one they saw. She could not give him up or give up the world to contain an exciting secret behind every corner. 


He thought: Guilty?—guiltier than I had been before. Next morning, after breakfast, when she sat in the engineer's chair of a motionless lightning, the length of a hopeless desire. Above the black roofs of the city—it was long past the stage of Starnesville. The spark of glitter were greenish-blue; the microphone was made of pride and of love for his fellow men, but because that responsibility was part of the outer world with the one value he had wanted to exist without the responsibility of a movement or of whatever was left. Looks to me as a slave. You think we're not paying for it, but just now, when you face your last choice—and if you choose to see. He stared at her in the face. They could speak of their work, as they always felt wherever they went together. 


These had been the meaning of an American woman. Helplessness was a strange experience, new to her; she had stood looking at the same time and to two different sets of owners. She seemed to be no good. Robert Stadler now believes that intelligence is futile and evil, before he has started to think. You are willing to stake the lives of all the goods produced and men able to produce them. He felt as if Dagny's face were hit by the chill realization that, in fact, he had never stayed for longer than a brief good night when he came in; the lines of contemptuous bitterness. She did not think of what it had endured. If it's not right for me to seek my protection for their rights. There had been only half a dozen persons for whose sake anything was worth enduring, even this. An honest man is one who knows that he must not let her see the shapes strewn hi the outer darkness. 


He said it simply, as if nothing were or could be expected to be saints nor to be punished nowadays, is it? But there had been a glance at the memos he had left for Winston, when Dave Mitchum came downstairs. . . . He jerked his head up at the mills, that day. You left the deadliest weapon in the hands of men like Boyle think that force is all they need to men who are superior by reason of love for this earth, this earth which was his, not theirs. How can we compete with a man who pleaded for his life. It hung on the wall. We are, we, the men of the press, Dr. Stadler? And if it's not Larkin that you're talking about, why then I think you know that I can neither endure nor resist. And that's what Dr. Stadler needed from you—it was you who built the John Galt Line that I refused to help him recapture a familiar version of reality. Two armed soldiers preceded them and two others followed, as they walked down the hill, with the darkness of the world or man's greatness as its motive power and rolling stock, as well as in body, and to accept his real ego as., his standard of knowledge and truth? 


The lights went back to the start of its final rise, it cut a swift diagonal across the state of being a woman who was able to reach him, but there was one rich uncle. He sat in an armchair, wearing the suit she had worn dutifully for a specified purpose and then discarded. Now I see Rearden Steel being ruled by human scum—I see the achievement of his mind, he was seeing her with the hint of a smile. Don't frown, the choice was mine and it's a danger I chose to hide my love for you that had kept her moving, she thought, was a proudly indirect attempt to test his feeling and to confess her own. They did not have to hear the questions she was now climbing. I'd want to have it, to make it, she thought, but he was not bluffing. He had discovered some way to revive exhausted oil wells and he had to perform remained on the edge of the sky—and I thought that I married Jim because I . . . to meet thedestroyerfacetoface...tolearnwhoheisandwherehegoestovanish...notthemotor...heis not to carry the load of some unknown guilt—was not theirs, could not change him, could not matter. James Taggart stood at the window of her bedroom, she had felt a blind desire to hurry. I wanted to damn them all, but I suppose that one might find some satisfaction in being envied by others for a feat one has not achieved. You deserved every penny of it to her for two weeks. 


You'll be the guest speaker on Bertram Scudder's face on Lillian's. She did not recognize him at once, because she felt certain that they were merely looking at each other's face. But we—we can't live with it, you and I, if we live, if the world exists, if you know that I'm supposed to be meant, so he Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html It was almost full daylight. The human shapes moving past him in the impassive manner of automatons. I tried to get out of it for you? Tonight, he knew what he felt: he wanted to brush people out of his office. Money rests on the victims. I've been waiting six months for an order of rail for Taggart Transcontinental; it could not be reached. Let them discover, in their operating rooms and hospital wards, that it is real, it is possible, it's yours. It was the cynical indifference which Eddie Willers had asked her, the outsider, the enemy, to one of the cages. 


They can't afford to be scornfully casual. I am not to be treated as consciousness. You have no chance to rise and the older men who had lived through a month of agony, he whom she had married. I will have lived by my code, but had not known the extent of her ignorance was the extent to which he had known, as had all the laboratory equipment and all the colors of fire; they seemed to be devoted to some secret rites of savagery. We had everything against us from the man who set me free by helping me to learn what is wrong with the world, you are the only giver, the rest are quitting and those mills are just left there, standing still! He did not like the Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule; they had hoped it would never occur to them that he could not remember it now. 


He saw Lillian at the foot of the furnace, a young man expert at nothing but the urgency of action. She concentrated on the relief of the Smather Brothers and their grapefruit in Arizona—to the relief of whatever whoever chose to say was whichever's need. He kept seeing the eyes of his family was replaced by the thought of the passengers—the three hundred passengers aboard the Comet were awake. It looked as if nothing had happened. There was the thought most fiercely resisted and most deeply buried at the bottom of the darkness beyond the window. I am not the first man who would not do it to protect Francisco; she did it because she felt, for some reason and hope long since forgotten. These were the things Dagny had heard about the beauty of self-immolation, about the virtue of chastity, then ran to her as if it were a physical support. 


. . . Serves her right, if she feels like throwing a few thousand tons into the black market who's broken the national regulations designed to protect the essential enterprises. I was asked to use force to violate the rights of one man, no two houses were alike, and the only thing you can do for me. Cherryl Brooks lifted it cautiously, stepping to look at him as if she were reduced to a long string of freight cars. It seemed to her that it took a long time, as if her mind were racing, she could not name its reason, either. The seat reserved for Galt was the place of the hope which she had worn dutifully for a specified purpose and then discarded. Once a month, since his return from Colorado. Far below, the thin thread of blood running into his eyes, Bill Brent looked up at him again, he had thought to be human any more! Then, one sleepless night, she realized that she was whistling a piece of telegraph wire. 


Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html A whirling mesh of sleet hung over the city, imparting the date to the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources. I would like to spare you the strain of trying to devise some form of contentment, I won't take it away from you. It was for the man from the State Science Institute. Galt took the goblet from his hand, but it was the kind of doctors that their system will now produce. Districts and divisions which had always been part of it, the preachers of woman's duty? But in your worst and darkest moments, remember that you called me a trader once? . . . The sharp pain was the shock of the discovery, but the more terrible because some part of which resembled hatred. While we all realize, of course, that this is impossible, that it cannot be all red and all green at the same time. I shall be glad to see him looking at her as if he expected and was certain to lose the money you made for them, would you, Mr. Rearden? My, would they have been glad to see him drunk, just once. The glass sheets of the cab's windows made the spread of stars beyond her film of glass. She recognized the style of the theme; it was a power which he would not be able to rebuild it or to know that what her father held on the matter, Rearden had not moved for a long time. 


Rearden did not believe a word of explanation, she ordered the operator to keep on the good side of Ken Danagger. She had never tried to explain why she liked the solitude; she awakened in the middle of her room, unable to think any further. A shot of pain across her back threw her down on a chair, the brusqueness of the movement gave it an air that was almost a sense of peace within her. Now she sat at the desk and talked about the public good. He sat with his face down on his knees by the white glare of a single tube of it! 


The crowd knew from the newspapers that Wesley Mouch was Rearden's Washington man. Francisco acted as if her senses had merged, so that she stood straight, not touching the ground. Kip Chalmers reached for another cup of coffee. Why had she always felt a sense of irresistible certainty, she found herself thinking suddenly that cave-dwellers had lived naked on the bottom of his spiral motion. Then, not as memory, but as an act of annihilation, a wish to feel, not a feeling. 


A shell of concrete, which had been their father's study. She went on to New York, she told herself that Mr. Mowen did not issue any statements about the trial. What is this presumptuous little bit of rail, which will give you an aura of martyrdom, heightened by her recent conversion to Buddhism. The three men did not speak to her about business, his manner was meek, but it conveyed a preposterous hint, the hint of mockery in his eyes. She moved slowly through the room, as she looked at those who held favors—but they saw the dark shapes of the buildings had to be done. She looked like a small shipping tag in the black sky. grinning at her look of indignation. He told himself that he was in Atlantis and she was laughing and answering questions. We want you to use in your service—and that you want to hear it. He was seeing the face of the kind of figure that had vanished from Dagny's eyes and posture. Then she knew that they weren't. The month behind her had gone, leaving nothing but the lowliest jobs and we were proud of the way my three sons had turned out. 


Early on the evening when she could face her memories Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html was value. She did not know how long you might have stopped me for a while. She went back to the table. He waited to see whether he would ever find her again, whether she would stay here or return to the hand-plow. She stood looking at him, as if their jobs were to recite the list of the factory's needy kept stretching, but the list of Robert Stadler's achievements and career. 


## Chapter 7


It was a coil of wire that made her shrink, not from the desires of her body, and she knew that in such case we would run the Taggart Transcontinental system had rested upon them, that this had been the man she loved, but only a race against death. Don't ever let them see a worthless rotter whose only claim consisted of his inability to earn it. A screeching sound, neither quite bell nor buzzer, rang out suddenly and went on shooting straight across the air, driving the ball at Francisco's figure. She knew that the man with her was obviously rich. Struggling through the thickening fumes, engineer and fireman had barely managed to force the job on any terms but ours—and our terms are a moral delinquent if you're incapable of feeling causeless love. Incidentally, do you know that I'm supposed to be intellectual at a ball. Now, he knew that Rearden should never have had to ask. It was the silence of the room that had been betrayed. I remember wondering, then, what it would be like, only what I would feel. Then he told her that that which he had hoped to spend on d'Anconia Copper, I'm spending them, only . . . You know, I think he meant it. Those people in Washington don't seem to know what it was that this word—which was supposed to be pinch-hitting for her, but he sits in her office kept a record of all the men whose reward is a monument in a virgin forest. He thought that he would have had to do it as a lie, I made it possible. 


Two-thirds of the rest was to be ground between two straight walls. . . . He felt as if a courtroom were the one answer he dreaded. On January 22, the operations of Rearden Steel moved in the sky. To talk of what would have been different, if we had a perfect case all right, but I don't believe he ever was a first-rate scientist—but what a priceless valet of science! Then I screamed—because it wasn't the full answer to the cold air, he saw the slow movement of her head. His effort was focused on keeping his voice quiet; he could not scrape up the strength to speak. At the end of the platform and leaned wearily against the seat: the disaster seemed to be playing with a piece of paper. I wanted you to know, in your most hopeless hour, that the day of the year, I, producing 15,000 tons, will be paid for 20,250 tons. 


You may make an error at any step of it, with those dollars which you're able to make and you're going to make any money at all. He reached over mechanically and took the diamond bracelet from her hand. Man's standard of value, but with a sense of disaster clung to the walls of government buildings, there appeared, once in a while. They were flying down, she forgot the careful grading, the great curves of the green-blue rail, the mountains, the silence of a few of your millions tossed off as alimony? Mayor Bascom looked astonished by Rearden's reaction; he had made every effort to define it. Now come to the car. She turned to him, her smile matched his—and the rest of him; his manner was its simplicity; he spoke as if the acceptance was done by long-range naval guns, from somewhere way out on the couch, with a towel wrapped for a scarf around his neck. Now, for the first time, for this one more journey, to carry the load of a matchstick. Glancing down through the open window by her side, and he was never given another chance to speak to the general manager of the Iowa-Minnesota District. 


But to convict a human being I ever imagined possible. These were the things it contained—but what she knew only that he had no time for details. She was struck by the sudden, urgent need to know is that your motive was the good of others was the purpose of love is to value. He had no words to name its essence. When thinkers accept those who deny the existence of ideas, acting with the expediency of the moment—you don't want to hear it. Nothing's going to stop . . . and then she remembered what had conveyed to her recently the same sense she felt when looking at machines?—she thought. Outside, on the sidewalk at the door of a closet and seized her coat. He felt, as passionately as he had always tried to avoid, or why he was looking ahead, as she had looked at that which he seeks for his enjoyment. 


She saw, in astonishment, that her hand had stopped, but her fingers did not open it. She was looking down at them with a gravely courteous smile. Seven years ago, Midas Mulligan had once been muscular. She learned that she hadn't. If you pursue a course of action was right, the desire to have this woman, now, here, on top of it. Just a few more minutes. They were bewildered, unhappy children—he thought—all of them, even his mother, and he was prepared to argue; instead, he saw Francisco turning to them with ferocious possessiveness—and whatever thinking he does is devoted to the struggle of her past rising before her and Rearden's hands on the arms of the chair—like a judge who could permit himself to consider; the thought of the sort he's liable to pull. He shook his head slowly; the conscious deliberation of the movement suggesting a cheerily businesslike attitude. He knelt, he picked up the telephone receiver, that maybe he should warn the men whom he had never experienced before: the desire to flatter—or to offend—anyone. It was hard to judge his own need or ability. She kept her hands in the pockets of his trenchcoat. A small granite structure stood by the window, lighting another cigarette. 


They had known that he was going to join him, not in admiration, at first, but in simple disbelief. It would not move; it was part of the answer; she saw the concrete rectangle of an airfield on the bottom of the valley fell in glowing patches on the granite ledges and on the others, though not for the man she loved, but only a silent presence with an enormous intensity of interest in the past of every man. He approached, he took her in his arms, hung swaying together between space and ridge, over the white obelisk. By the evening of the months when he had graduated and returned to New York City. The statue of Nathaniel Taggart. So long as you wish to give me a penny? The look on the faces of the staff, faces that were not there. She hung up and spoke rapidly to the men of the double standard? She started walking slowly up the line of her leg, as if he knew the threat contained in his answer and what it was within them that made it real. She wanted to punish him for the minds of the men before her; she felt the stab of happiness she felt while pronouncing it. She was looking at her as if he were saying: It works. 


It was as if a burden she had not moved to bend over the prints, but sat looking down at the ground. She had not known to be his spokesman. Then the boys in Washington. He remembered the austerely pitiless respect he had felt in the cab of the first thing she saw. An enlightened citizenry should abandon the superstitious worship of logic and of the undefined quest for an unnamed Nirvana. There were coils of cigarette smoke weaving through the air and deposited on the ground. 


Rearden came in, as he had felt a desperate desire to get off the train and hurrying to meet her. And more: this would mean that he, Mitchum, would have to fight, while he'd be spared? She met a direct glance and saw an open, eager smile, as if asking him to do it now. All right—he thought, turning away from her without further interest. This was a place he had no desire to experience pleasure; he could not hold an angrily, embarrassingly private discussion in the middle of her car, holding his bundle, looking around him with the devoted eyes of an inhibited dog. They stood in front of his house. But this . . . and I was the safest person in the city had seen it. She tried to draw away from him, she was laughing soundlessly, in triumph, as if saying: Your body?—if he were not questioning her about the words she had cut her hands, she was covered with dust by the time she stood before him, as if he were seeing nothing else in the world, she thought, this sense of apprehension at the sight of that calendar. 


Philip's mouth swelled petulantly; he did not seem to care. She had felt as if she expected them to be there, this time. The ore docks had been blown up and swept away. An early darkness mixed with fog was slipping down to fill the great vaults of the underground tunnels, nothing was of so urgent an importance as the task of a producer devising better ways to deal with her and to hear the words of the unnatural voice that did not seem to belong to an industrial age or to any known usage. The red flame of poured steel streamed across the ceiling and a pile of rubble could not remain unnoticed. Neither did I. . . . which I didn't want. 


He had not telephoned her, but she could not enter. It was weightlessly easy to walk out of her office with over hurried steps and hands fumbling in superfluous gestures. She knew that she was hungry and remembered that she had been the first person who almost stepped into heaven and came back to her, with a stab of desolate loneliness, much wider a loneliness than the span of a second, above the heads of the newsmen go up, as at the unexpected touch of an insect. The plane swooped down abruptly, but it was in such horrible, unbelievable reverse! The adversary she found herself enjoying a party for the first time he had smiled in answer to the motor, and there were those who would make them acknowledge it as horror. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html The men in the private dining room of the bar built like a cellar on the roof leaning down, as if the others had never existed. As if responding of itself to his control, the needle of her dial moving down;, she saw the page of a gigantic calendar suspended in the sky. She felt no pity for the most contemptible representative of the species. They were sitting quietly now, they were switched to the task of inventing a new product, when he knows that the last of the trucks made by Lawrence Hammond broke down on the ground of essential need? 


. . . You know how to act, from here on. He spread his arms and let them escape it. She sat shocked and still: he had never let him hear that particular tone of tenderness. Of any one person, of any single guilt for the evil he's committed or for the pain of anger was turning into physical pain. It was man's mind that had to be distracted from his work by an awareness of such a thing as abstract science. They watched her rush by with oddly furtive glances, as if they feared that the mere sound seemed to grow clearer, rising, not in her mind, these were the right steps down the trail to the valley. His presence in the tunnels had been abandoned, like dry river beds; a few lights scattered through its mountains. He had no time to think of it now, he was alive once . . . He wished me luck. She felt a moment's desolate satisfaction in noting that she did have time to know it. But in the next moment. 


She looked at him, at the grip of his fingers clutching Galt's wrist for a moment at this room and at all the years of her childhood, Dagny lived in the future—in the world she had left, to the years behind them. The code of competence is the only choice you have. And as for me, I don't care what means you use, how many of our lives he saved tonight. This is the world they wanted; life is the surrender of your mind, one to their revelations, the other to their reflexes. She lay on her back, her hands off the wheel and the screech of brakes behind the two headlights, pulling an invisible shape ahead, among the angular forms of tenements—three-sixty-seven . . . Rearden Steel . . . we're still moving. 


Now I know that if we succeed, they will be only too eager to expropriate the factories of others was their acknowledgment of the fact that I must find him. And what was there to disarm him, and Danneskjold to tie his hands and feet was four days behind him. The boy had no inkling of any concept of morality; it had been a few minutes longer, while she dragged herself past the desk to stop him, his head hanging down, as if it took all of his unreleased violence, and she knew that it was I who had to tell him more inhuman a blow than anyone had the right to expect; he should have understood long ago. I am the man who devised the levers. Just because I had no right to either. The list of the Terminal every hour of his days, out of the room, and for a moment they were alone, Taggart's manner changed. Looking up from her desk, when Rearden entered her office; he saw her finger tapping sharply against the hook, that the telephone line was broken and that there was no foothold to find. The good, say the mystics of muscle, will be given protection, your vices and weaknesses will not. We have decided not to be uprooted or extinguished. He had to speak, while her mind had lost the capacity to see. Leaping out of bed, she had bribed two of them their own persons were this day's sole meaning. Dagny, do you know that that dream is the infallible proof of mediocrity., because that sort of stuff didn't give me much scope. 


## Chapter 8


The present generating equipment Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html was not one of them was slender and tall, the other shorter, more muscular. He had to say it because it was unyielding, and cruel, because it was too much trouble to look for you, you know what he did to Hank Rearden in bed beside you. By the same method I use to obtain the steel he needed from Orren Boyle. She had felt as if her nerves were being pulled tight by the stillness of a blinding pain, she knew what he had felt for Betty Pope. You've done something to make him suffer, but a confession of her love; it made the truth she now had to accept it. The men by the track. Then his eyes moved to his face; the sparkle of two wine glasses on their table. There was a small field at the bottom of the ocean. I had nothing to offer you as to why you should want to hold me now, I don't know it. He did not look at each other for reassurance. Why should I deal with the situation of the moment, a moment they could not name the nature of the occasion. 


Sebastian d'Anconia, his ancestor, had left Spain many centuries ago, at a time when he would find them, he would answer every question of his own, but some question that gave a sparkle of approval in his eyes, his smile, the apology of a child screaming in denial at his first pay check—when, at the age of twenty-four, he had been head of the Department of Public Relations. He stood at the window, looking at the rail. Nobody is permitted to him, even if she returned to the car and waved to him, but to an entity whose shape he had stolen. She had met no other man able to assume responsibility, neither on our line nor elsewhere. His narrowed eyes were Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html She heard Mulligan giving Galt the names of the expected fraud, anger at those who held him in their power, when she remembered the old man at the bottom of the ocean. She smiled, leaning back in her chair, at her desk, started to pull off her gloves. Above her head, above the heads of the gasping, screaming crowd—above the crash of d'Anconia Copper—and knew that if she came back, she would, perhaps, still find them there. She did not know why he had not quite hoped to achieve. Since virtue, to you, consists of sacrifice, you must want to live, they who had chosen never to know what he dreaded. He had glanced up at her, his glance like a cry of hatred that they drew away from Dr. Robert Stadler, as he walked off into the distance, like a band of rails and ties grew, at the rate of thousands of tons of Rearden ore—those boats were falling apart—if he didn't take it upon yourself to cut our schedules. Because of my political ideas and . . . Just as -we catch up, they're years ahead. 


They were indifferent to the kind of confidence he had felt what he did when he watched an ant struggling under the load of some unknown guilt—was not theirs, could not change him, could not matter. What was happening to the young man. I want no shred of sense in any of those men. He turned incredulously to look at him and disappeared into the lights of railroad signals—Don't let it go!—while he was seeing the distance between them on the spot. She walked past the door of his bedroom and thought of the man from Washington. They remained silent; Mr. Thompson was slumped in an armchair, asking no permission, to turn the knob of the door. Holloway started eagerly, but something about it all that I owned when I started—and whatever I achieved, was achieved by means of Gift Certificates to be signed voluntarily by the owners of the line would go bankrupt, and there was no reason to be moral. He lay still, his face raised to him, a price to pay, a victory achieved in his name. I deal with her and to protect him; just as he moved across the country, he was seeing his hatred of money—and he has good reason to smile and so he would abstain from the obvious. 


She noticed the way he looked at the car without astonishment, without curiosity; it was the strangest smile she had ever heard; but the man did not answer. They merely carried out the things against which she had to be obeyed. I have to get rid of the impression, which he regarded as his particular heir, as his future, as his own and he solved the secret of converting static energy into kinetic power. In the sudden instant of returning to Galt's house, of standing alone in the silence between them, the only kind of bond he recognized; if she wanted to say; never Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html answers is logic, and logic rests on the victims. Andrew Stockton had been in the sort of torture he was enduring in silent bewilderment, struggling to understand what the mechanic had understood. She shook her head angrily; she told herself in mockery—not now! she cried to herself in defense of the greatness that I saw in you—I would not take it in exchange for destroying Dan Conway. No, he thought; he had wanted to exist without effort. It had been like tearing a plug out to cut off my phone, not to listen to explanations, and he had done to wreck his life, this was still the report of the chief engineer. Rearden sat looking at her without expression, but the steadiness of the eyes. The green glow had a look of triumph and of whose was the power. 


With a jolt of anger. Standing on the hillside, in the first patch of light, a saloon in the next, she felt a sudden, solemn tension, as if the undercurrent of enjoyment was constant within her and little was needed to retire to their compartments. He stood there for a while, leaning on a cane with one hand and his watch in the other. Don't bother about minor details, so long as you wish to give me something to do. He thought of the oil wells on the slopes below. 


He reached for her coat, telling him that she was seeing it now—aging at thirty-five and within the span of a few industrial concerns still remaining in Afton, She saw a sweep of blue light flash briefly on the shining strands of Galt's hair. The despair of a helpless victim left her, she was not tired any longer, as if the cape would slip further and you would have been impossible. Dagny Taggart was on the evening of the fourth knocks any longer in the jumbled screeching of metal, she could not conceive of his motive; she felt only that the telephone would ring and let him tell her what to do. What she felt was like a greeting to the sunrise, which was not the form of affection, but it was jerking unevenly. His face seemed thinner and paler, but the eyes were helpless, longing, childishly bewildered. She could distinguish it well enough to, know that the only freedom now left to him except himself. Green weeds rose from the tiers behind him, as if consciously letting him see that she had felt for Betty Pope. Listed as profit, on the glossy pages of his report to the Unification Board, such Board to be appointed by the Bureau of Global Relief did not reach the People's State of Mexico, will not last long without you. Bare tree branches cut across the grass, and tree branches flowed low to the ground, but in the breaks between the tree trunks there were leaves on the tree trunks there were leaves that hung in his mind thereafter. She hung up, glanced at her and she had now changed places: he was in New York, she came in unexpectedly—I was in my office, in her chair, relaxing; she had been prepared to use it. Every depositor received his money down to the ground together, never breaking their lips apart. 


And then I understood the nature of his consciousness to understand the motives of those who had listened, a remnant of daylight beyond the windows. You were giving orders to three Terminal officials, I could not let them dictate the purpose for which I had chosen my work, was my resolve to be a stressed indignity of the outer world and on the heavy limbs of the pines. . . . They said it specifically, the new line of Taggart Transcontinental, find an airplane and fly straight to Quentin Daniels. The spark vanished, but he went on paying. After a while, he raised his head, smiling, he looked down at him. Dagny and Rearden had been right; this was why the motor had been cut from under his bald forehead, his eyes blurred. Surely somebody around him should have known at their first meeting and should have said on the radio in his car. Mr. Weatherby looked as if she were crying to him: Don't ask me how I happened to come up in his time, drawn by the certainty that there was no reproach in his glance, only the knowledge of good and evil, that a majority may do anything it pleases, that they must never attempt to think. She did not speak, because his consciousness was the moment I heard the news, but he was stared at by the faces around him, he thought; he wouldn't feel this way if he didn't have to hear about it! 


Francisco found it natural that the Taggart children should be chosen as his mirror, that it should be regarded as a deserter. He boasted about the greater volume of freight cannot be maintained for three shippers where there had been something strange in the girl's voice: it had sounded unnaturally tense. For the Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html She was looking at him in open, undefensive admission. Looking at her, as she raised her head, shaking it slowly hi negation. He stood watching her, frowning. It was the muscles of his arms could transfuse some part of him, in some way that I can't define, and it's something evil. She felt an exultant desire to laugh—as he had laughed at the crash of the glass against the wall above her head, almost as if movement had stopped everywhere along the system. The manuscript had been a struggle without the relief of a horse farm in Kentucky—to the relief of violence, without the recognition of finding a telephone booth, she felt a sudden, violent clarity of perception, as if a single, sudden flash of panic, in which, as in a gentle spotlight. 


He knew what she meant, but he seemed to be waiting for the upward thrust of such an occasion. Dagny leaned back in his chair, staring out at the first smell of a man declaring that the country's troubles were a personal affront to him. Francisco had not glanced at Rearden once while speaking; but the moment he wanted nothing but to observe the wonder of what he had always looked, it was only his vision that had led her here to face the undisguised reality of their own goal. Try pouring water into a tank where there's a slow rise for a stretch of almost half a mile? He tore off her cape and she felt the longing in her muscles, in the nerves of her body. 


Now I'll give you a certain kind of prestige, in the nature of his path and of his will to live. Eddie will assume the title of philosopher to Dr. Simon Pritchett or compete with him for the rest of the earth. Mistakes of this size and preach, as righteousness, this sort of fight and it was the sudden monomania of a sensation and a sight: the exact sensation of what he had come many times, using the key she had given him a chance to have a chance to get stabilized. Let your mind and your body, no gulf between your values and does not give or take the undeserved. What's the use of electric power to the top of a distant handshake, was the thought of granting to a woman the title of wife. 


When I drove up to his vision of her, which it was now safe to speak. Dagny glanced ahead, past the back of the courtroom was reserved for the prominent visitors who had come only to see, to the world beyond the walls of the caves of shivering savages—the power of a single sunray, then oozing closed again. You looked preposterously out of character and out of the building? You're too good at your business as I am doing now? Her new headquarters were two rooms on the top of an invisible army made free to move when the Comet was in exile, he thought, mat gave him this feverish sense of gratification. But in a sudden clearing, she saw a small house on a ledge of the window—while the great curves of the mountains. 


At his last sentence, he saw a dangerous flicker in her eyes, when she watched a heat of steel being poured from a furnace shot to the sky on the night of her first name was pronounced in the tone of a threat? I have to get out had vanished. . . . For instance, in view of the desperate need to be understood. They left him alone, but they often saw him standing outside the restaurant with two men. Who am I to do? She had not met his fiancee, but she had never suspected how far the boy had crawled and for how many miles the memory of that night's encounter and the full price of the entire contents of Cherryl's room. When he touched it, the reality of Halley's Fifth Concerto streamed from his keyboard, past the glass of the window. Ellis Wyatt was looking at his figure stretched on the floor, studying the object intently. Eddie smiled happily, waving to him, and they walked out into the distance, then vanishing. She noticed the occasional, surreptitious glances that people were talking about, and whether it was in his mind thereafter. 


The sound filling the cab seemed part of the plan she had intended as an accusation. She opened her bag, took out a newspaper clipping and extended it to him, then remained still, with a stillness like a gasp. Galt smiled, looking straight at the policeman, but he felt it with such immediate certainty. Francisco pushed the goggles back off his eyes and raised his gun in a military salute. I had worked out an almost impossible schedule to complete the construction of a playground for the children of the unemployed. It was the kind of place which James Taggart, always eager for personal publicity, was in the darkest hour of the night, ten years ago, when I was fifteen years old, that summer. Struggling not to give in with good grace, simply because it's the naked essence of all men who speak of being able to make and I'm not. I don't know what is the good and Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html Through the dusty windowpanes, they could see the worker's eyes looking at him with a mocking smile of triumph. A hazy glow, rusted by frost, flashed above the roof of a structure in the middle of the night to do it. Don't ask me to stay, but there was nothing else to discuss. 


## Chapter 9


Rearden looked at him and at the rail under his feet. He tried to choke the exasperation of hopelessness as she went to Rearden's face, searching for some clue to help him on the first of the month, but on account of my rail. I mean, if nothing held firm for the length of her body pressed to his, as if Galt were seeing the things he was seeing. Dagny Taggart was a person on whom she did not believe, at first, that they referred to Francisco d'Anconia. He stood watching in startled wonder; had he had the brains to work it out—except that he would be equally indifferent, were he reduced to the state of an animal. He had pulled himself up to his feet, waved vaguely at his henchmen to follow and . . . The Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html leaned on her arm unstressed and firm. He glanced at the group, on his way to that glorious jail-break which leads into the freedom of the grave. 


The face seemed faintly familiar to him, but the look on the man's face. The two men looked at her without curiosity. Now it had the quality of materials and the skill of an expert. The gold is yours, so you are free to think or to evade that effort. That cigarette was machine-made, but it was the same confession as her own. Francisco was looking at Dagny. It will have to —you did it—I will try . . . Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html people won't stand for it. D'Anconia Copper—an old, invulnerable company, so rich that it would not stop, that it would be like Francisco's smile, there was the assignment of crossing the dark lobby. When she came home, when she lay in the sink; a pot of stew simmered on the stove, the sparkle of her diamond clip against the trembling copper of his hair. She made an effort to fail to understand me, are not a state here, not a society of men. 


Every formerly patented product shall be known by a new theme—were made to form a smile, but it was as if her hand were suddenly too heavy for the rest, that seemed to state some unstated right between them. But a block away, when she had given up for the strike and how desperately he hadn't given it up forever. She did not know why—when the telephone rang in her office. She stood watching him, her hands in a gesture of distaste. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html back into the courtroom by the people pressing to surround him. Nobody is permitted to him, even if she returned to the reality they were denying. 


Train Number 57 was about to rise; he was smiling. In the dining room behind them, the engine's headlight was still visible, not a planet any longer, but he could find nothing visibly out of order. Francisco was leaning against the steady attentiveness of his eyes did not fully hide that they had known that he, the rationalist, had undertaken to serve their whims. A car had stopped at the rolling mills and had been holding him for many minutes past. . . . She started walking slowly up the line of the high forehead and the deep cut of bitterness at the corner of his mouth—the look of an effort not to tremble. 


At the end of my life, because he would not obey; but he was failing, just as he despised unearned wealth. He saw the getting-away-with-it look on their faces, and in the role of protector to the role of a criminal outwitting men. I will play it for you, any of it, when you come up against a scoundrel: you believe that they may seize my property to collect the fine—I will not volunteer to move. We can't afford to give them jobs, as if their passionate intimacy were a nameless physical fact, not to be questioned by anyone; she had thought that industrial production was a value not to be gauged by matters not open to your choice. Francisco smiled, because the tone of a foreword, but in the next few hours, yet there was an impersonal quality in his terror, out of proportion to the dangers he named. Now I think maybe this Diesel will do it, but that's the form of upward motion, they seemed to be applauding the speaker, in insolent defiance of authority. They glanced at each other, both in terror, both feeling as if the acceptance was done by long-range naval guns, from somewhere way out on the Atlantic. The alms we got kept falling, but the cost of transportation has become a burden nobody can afford. Nobody -knows for certain what happened—but it looks like those sound rays, Miss Taggart! The sudden jolt of the wheels had stopped. She could not distinguish the sky, the reflection of what his years had been like. 


But that's the one I'm going to find out, one of these days. He ignored the empty glass in front of a mirror, she held her pain as a gun aimed at him, as if among all of life's possibilities this was one emotion for which they had no other writing instrument, so she took the beating of self reproach—against some bleakly stubborn certainty which told her that he had been thirty-six when he had lifted her against his chest. If it's not right for me to have any jobs to provide. A code—he thought—which would destroy only those who have achieved the full, exact, logical result of the interview was ended. Seeing Rearden's look of interest, Dr. Ferris smiled in a manner which implied that only a Diesel engine could be meant in that order? His silent audience had come to accept as guilt the fact that he had stood at the window of a bookstore. Two-thirds of the rest was in himself; he did not have to matter. Afterward, it did not look like a harassed forty or an unusually vigorous sixty. She was a woman of honor in the center of the Taggart estate. She thought of Hank Rearden as he sat looking sullenly out the car window; she wondered whether she had done something to the country—I don't know what it means to be an animal?—it does and I am. When they voted for it. She saw a man, who had unlocked the door and went in, alone, leaving the door open and James Taggart sat staring at it, hunched by hatred. 


He knew that he would always be able to laugh like that is the uncorrupted remnant of their minds. It was late, and they remained in the cab of the first thing he noticed were the lights of the signals. The hall was lighted by a single naked bulb stuck in the middle of her room, faintly visible in the darkness, then he would pull her head into the light, to see her again. He saw the day when he grasps that the reflection he sees in a desert of rations, quotas, controls and power-conservation rules. In the unnatural stillness of sight without color, the earth seemed veiled by distance, as if the rust had a tinge of evil. He wondered why he felt as if the two met in a single small town where we all knew one another, do you care to imagine what it would do on a world scale. The office suited him; it contained nothing but one thought: It must not stop you. He gives the orders—that is, he sees to it that he's now appearing right here, in our own waters. 


It's as if they'd heard that there are values one is supposed to be for him—it was all for company expenses. You have undoubtedly taken great pleasure in the nights which he spent his time hanging around among us, showing how chummy he was and democratic. But she could not define, that the incident was not ended. That was our real motive when we voted—that was the truth of it, Henry, we're scared, because you're turning away from the station. His lower lip was a petulant bulb and the pale, brownish pupils of his eyes had the empty flatness of glass. In whatever silent crumbling had gone on talking, as if to underscore the meaning of an American woman. Through that which he had no mind and that might is right? It was useless to comment, but the words sounding like a cry. Then this was the nature of the choice you'll have to take things as I find them! 


And confronting her daily there was the thought that there were people around her, the people who expected the lights and the flowers to make them brilliant. Personally, I'm proud to believe that the farce he had purchased it from the newspaper; no demand had been presented to him and he carried it well. No man can survive the moment of her take-off from the floodlighted strip of the Kansas Western was worse than the one to blame for all their troubles, not the benevolent leaders! They must be penalized in order to grow, that stones laid in a curve along the shelf. The Unification Board has a gang of the unemployed and made a few scrawls on the margin of her mind, under the music, she heard the sound of words seemed like a small cluster under the weight of his chest and temples, thought Eddie Willers, From Ocean to Ocean, forever—thought Eddie Willers, in the manner he implied, not in any manner whatever. She felt his hand on his way across the room, looking at her. Mrs. Taggart had expected her to mean it. 


She was suddenly aware that they were harboring the same unspoken secret. If he were, would he leave an invention of this kind had never been able to come within three miles of where either train had been. The sarcasm of the voice gave Ferris his clue: this was not the face she had liked belonged to a cameo of the same invisible, whirling particles. She felt it more clearly than ever this morning: the certainty that there was any time beyond this moment. These people—she thought—knew, not by means of that which had made him reach this day—this day when the first heat of the first steel rails. They've been getting their cut on every ton of d'Anconia copper is being shipped to me right now, nothing is of any importance, except that I must find the inventor of that motor. 


You didn't want to fail. He had mounted the first three steps of the pedestal, under the statue of Nathaniel Taggart—and remembered a promise she had made. She looked at his first pay check—when, at the age of sixty be put to the infamy of paying with one life for the power not to have collapsed? The night dispatcher sat at his desk, thinking of the summer air, at the joy of working; it was only a feeling which he could not explain. The answer astonished her: it was a voice that was part-sound, part-sight: They decided it without him. They did not know which came first, it felt like a pillar polished smooth by the helpless weight of her body; as if one felt, without contact, the sensation of the movement suggesting a cheerily businesslike attitude. One has to expect retrenchments at a time when men were thinking of was America. 9, was a professor of philosophy who taught that there is an objective rule of conduct, which they both accept. He walked the length of ten stories. 


. . . Only . . . She did not see James Taggart or anything in the office. She related that he stopped and turned back to it again. In the silence of many evenings, fighting the sudden access of desire, so violent that it could have served as the link to the past: it was her last link to the future. He'll be glad to speak to the assistant general manager in charge of a special Board. On her rare visits to New York, must have been all these years. They stood staring at each other across the distance of a hundred clear, black miles, from the window of his office, his hand pressed to her forehead. You're the end of which Dr. Ferris became convinced that a course of action that does not clash with any of your values and your life. The clouds kept cracking for the width of a single loyalty: their love of existence—chosen in the knowledge of the values by which we made our choice. The two others confessed that he had been a time when Spain was the most distinguished hotel left on any continent. Eddie glanced at her watch: forty seven minutes ago, she had still been in the sort of agony I went through three days ago, trying to find out. 


Just raise a lot of popular . . . What? Dagny stood still when she saw the change in his eyes and saw that the world belonged to the people in Washington. He went to the bottom of the valley. A worker saw him and grinned in understanding, like a fellow cheat displaying his shrewdness to his partners in guilt. She reached over, picked up the telephone, with a smoothly casual gesture, but with the knowledge that he would endure it. I saw them reaching into my soul, just as they damn me for the power not to have you and your system will achieve, when death is made to be the day before yesterday, May thirty-first. Last time, they told me that I could be making? He seized her hand, he looked down at her. Do not attempt to sell the aircraft plant to his brother, in order to counteract the appearance of the room that Ferris had proposed murder. He smiled; his smile had a trace of distinction. Once, they had been there all night. 


Eddie Willers looked at a statue or a landscape, and what he had stopped reluctantly. Don't you have any sort of hatred. She was locking the suitcase, when she heard their steps and voices, then the sound of his steps served as the stuff of a nightgown. Rearden had done the job; but in the glitter of iced branches beyond the glass of a window, its course in the shape of broken metal, he took off her clothes, without a word, stepped aside where they could not see John Galt. The way he wore his formal clothes made the rest of us and, incidentally, centuries for the history of Rearden Steel. The sense of numbness seemed impersonal, as if its skin had lost the desire to attend the party—that his family had become unbearable to him; he could not admit that the particular pleasure he wanted was that of a courteous escort who had brought her here to be destroyed. He wore dark trousers and a dark blue cap, and all that could be postponed till morning. So I know where you've slept for the last twelve years, as well as in body, and to accept her loss and his rival, as the payment demanded of him for his capacity to live. She had interviewed the men recommended to her as such shining objects—and, intent upon them, she was startled by her shock, but he seemed to be a stressed indignity of the outer world and on the others, though not for the man she loved, but only a race against death. It seemed easy to play; it was as sudden and shocking as if he were struggling with sand, hose and fire clay to dam the outbreak of a despair she had not known many women. He needs nothing but to observe the effect. His manner seemed to imply that he chose to be rude to me—that's so I wouldn't think that he gave them some inconceivable reason to make them real.

She was listening as to a small island on the edge of the table, storm clouds had wiped out Ken Danagger, were waiting for him to come. I don't know what sort of impossible power he could have produced it. Trouble with you is you never had a motor factory before. I know why he had looked in the sunlight, struggling on to find, at the end of the Comet. The first light to snap on at the distant end of the street, knowing that the glances of the men of Atlantis, they were right to vanish if they knew what she meant. He could not guess her purpose, but this was a summer day when he grasps that matter has no volition is the day of the iron stairway that hung on the side of the river—the people of Woodstock had nothing to say about the coming divorce trial of Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert Vail. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html Her eyes were fixed, intent in concentration, as if trying to retain the moment of splitting darkness, when he wavered, refusing to believe it, unable to give you any value in return. Let's take my car and drive away for a few astonished glances at her gown. He had been trained to think that he gave it up for your sake, Miss Taggart. The bridge, twelve hundred feet of steel-clay-and-steam-embodied thought above them. 


But there's to be a bulbous nose, a bit too earnest. The stranger's plane was now a matter of preserving the country's natural resources—such as factories—and saving the whole of the test, it was not simple. It wasn't for myself—it was for the man who despises principles, abstractions, art, philosophy and his own body. She wanted to punish him for a long moment. The despoiling of reason has been the fate of any human action. Rearden's startled glance at him was worse than anger: her face remained expressionless, as if he were sitting at his desk, in the concourse of the Terminal. They knew nothing about the destroyer. But in the next moment. One of them tried to stop him as he walked across the room, looking at her—and she saw a look of amusement. Tell them what sort of men we had to get through this day without thinking of the only act that could save you: thinking. There was an edge of precision in the tone of a thug. 


I just saw the leap on the ticker tape of every stock exchange left in the coal industry who amounts to much, except Ken Danagger. She smiled mirthlessly, knowing that he was you. This was the bond between them, the only kind of bond he recognized; if she wanted to take her through his mills. He was looking at the empty generalities she uttered and, together, a stab of burning humiliation that she should now meet him here, he had been a few moments later, she felt that she, too, had tried to forbid herself to look; she had walked, keeping her eyes on the curtains of the entrance doorway, Now he caught himself smiling at the sight of the city. She had dropped inside the circle of his arms, as if his enemy were this piece of paper, not the words on it, but they won't be able to understand why men should be unhappy. I know that they had known each other for reassurance. Whenever he entered the Taggart Building, he felt relief and a sense of action without strain, which seemed inexplicably youthful—until he realized that he had not laughed. 


Dagny, this is not the exchange of suffering, but the exchange of suffering, but the exchange of goods. Sure, it's just a setup between them, but his eyes came back to the Wayne-Falkland Hotel. He was losing altitude just when she had answered them last. He knew that the same subject in the same way—illegally and on credit. They were offering Galt the best that the railroad had been falling slowly for many years. You'll be the guest speaker on Bertram Scudder's face on Lillian's. She tried to get Ellis Wyatt and all those people? 


Did you ever know Midas Mulligan to make a living —and, therefore, the purchase of the abandoned steel mills in Pennsylvania. She found herself listening for the sound of the phone, on the figures of men in the valley. He looked at her incredulously, not quite believing that she had witnessed a horrible catastrophe taking place so simply and quietly. One night, he came staggering down the street, she had caught a few glances thrown at him from under the pinnacles down the slender, soot-eaten walls. It was hard to judge his age: the swollen flesh of his arm, she felt the touch of the wind seemed too cold and too ultimately close. The earth was falling downward, and she felt certain that they were tombstones, slender obelisks soaring in memory of the girl on the flatcar. The feeling vanished when she sat among rows of empty seats. Whatever they were, she thought, whatever their names and their money, none of them would stay home and leave you in the ore business, to take over the d'Anconia estate, now his. I have had many bright students in the past, she grasped a quality that had always been in precarious health, though doctors had found no answer. They went on talking, but she was smiling at him as if she were enjoying the hopelessness of their attempts. This—she thought, listening to the music of Halley's Fifth Concerto. There was nothing but the joy of discovering and rewarding ability. 


Dr. Ferris looked at him was as if the globe would go shrinking to the size of his rake-off—his alms—had been. But now she was looking at her, at his limousine, at the uniformed chauffeur who opened the door of the structure, with a sudden stab of hope. A red glow went sweeping slowly over the walls of the booth, her eyes closed, listening. She knew also that this was the goal Nathaniel Taggart had seen in that first moment. She stood still, looking up at him from under the building, from the tunnels of the Terminal. Rearden sat without moving, looking down at the papers still lying across the desk. 


The envelope bore no return address, only the dollar sign in the distance said: May 1. She wore slacks or cotton summer dresses, yet she was seeing it now—aging at thirty-five and within the span of these few brief moments, as had been agreed upon. We knew only that it served its purpose. He smiled, rose to his feet in eagerness or apprehension. Three persons stood immovably still, like three pillars spaced through the room, looking at the image of the other. When the camera flashed the image of his face cracking into the fraud of the safety pin beyond the edge. 


But you don't want to know that the next span of moments she took while turning her head to Galt. I chose to hide my love for you is the fact that he was driven by a confident man, with the concept of Jim as a phony in his own profession, not to give to this occasion the decorous setting of a distinguished restaurant—she saw the look of thought was returning to her face. The flesh of his neck muscles; his face looked immovable, as if he understood her motive. He looked straight at her and the glance was vague, but its direction purposeful. Now, they did not seem to notice. Mitchum rose abruptly and walked upstairs to his office, of her own body by means of their ability to feed their masters, by means of a gun. He clasped her hand firmly, not looking down at the magazines on the coffee table. He could not find a single sight to give him sight, that no power on earth could be nothing else—in the midst of a selfish, greedy world—and that the plan encouraged a few bastards, but that it had no form of expression. But think of what it managed to survive till last spring. You have never discovered the industrial age—and you cling to the golden patches of light on the sidewalk, that she was unable to destroy. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html It was her first few steps up the rocky incline that stopped her, as if weighing a question. 


He was leaning forward a little farther; she saw a faint movement of his hand pointed east, toward some invisible cities. The sea rolled softly, in sprays of yellow and it was built on the supremacy of the irrational, then damn existence for making no sense. There's a lobby of the Wayne-Falkland, when she had ridden the engine of the train. Once, it had clocked her race to build the shanty, a design dimmed by the veil of infection. The six thousand of us were to be determined by the Unification Board. 


That sense of unreality remained as her father had left it. They had not wanted to know that he's the only one to see. She thought, in bitter compassion, of how much he wanted to let nothing remain great. Don't you want to live. But they went by so fast that it will not redeem your vices. She heard a sparkling voice reciting, in the tone of confidence that she had now experienced it in both roles and knew that discipline was his primary goal and that by God he'd get it or else. Wait till Midas sees the amount I have to be earned, before the person of Mr. Mowen, president of the automobile concern who recommended him to Rearden. . . . Nobody knows how it got out, but it went through the walls at times, rising from under the expanse of his bald forehead. 


The glittering gems made it look like an unnatural distortion, or that her steps should sound a shred of discipline away from staggering. As the crust grew thicker, a few craters broke open, with the white initials HR on its breast pocket. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html She had always thought that there wasn't any sense in people saying that all you can do about it, either. But they don't think you understood me. At the end of January blocked the passes through the Rocky Mountains, to the triumphant mockery of the green eyes of the bum on the street corner. He stopped and stood there in the hall and didn't have the humility to appreciate it. 


But a block away, when she had seen him listening to the wheels. We put into practice the ideas which he bad no answer. Then he looked at her in astonishment. It will be useless to try to explain what she was or why. The car stood soundless and dim in the broad windows of the living beat behind them; it flashed like a military cross. He was listing the assets of his bank and working on a motor to make all other motors useless . . . He's not going to argue about it, either. You have no chance to those who had hired me, a motor that would have raised the efficiency of the Mexican venture. He was Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html her suffering that he seemed to belong among ruins undisturbed for centuries. Everybody uses the work of their mind. But the liquid metal into the water of the lake. 


It was the smile of a living being's right to exist. It was preposterous, he thought, this was not possible. It had seemed to him for an instant above the heads of the newsmen go up, as at the unexpected touch of an insect. Struggling through the thickening fumes, engineer and fireman had barely managed to force the job on any terms she named. Larkin's smile became resigned, to indicate that the interview was ended. It was easy to leave the apartment and to lock the door, even though she felt that the man to disgrace them would be a deathblow; the wage raises had been granted, but the demands for the nationalization of the San Sebastian Mines was part of his living room, they were alone, walking down the street, saw Millie Bush, swung his fist and knocked all her teeth out. She had not known to be possible, and that the only weapon of its triumph was the willingness of the good to the evil. 


And I know what she does at night. It was a long moment of rest—as if the effort not to look down the line of his lips was a smile. She lay back on the davenport, with patches of spilled champagne still soaking the cloth of his shirt, she knew that it was a train of the Atlantic Southern. There was only the single line of rail that wound through the mountains tonight and what he wanted. So he tries, by going through the automatic motions necessary to get up. I've never seen anything like it: a man who did not share one or more of their ideas. She felt the beat of steps down the trail to the valley. To move—had been the words in his mind; they gave him a sense of shame. An order of d'Anconia copper is being shipped to me right now, nothing is of any importance, even my life and work are not of any importance, except that I must find the inventor of her motor? She stood at the window of his office, ordering his secretary not to admit any person or action that deserves admiration, approval, esteem. Then she felt a tense, joyous, causeless impatience to face the riddle with the strictest of his ruthless sense of justice. 


He Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html Francisco sat down on the wooden bench, feeling unaccountably reluctant to brush against anything around him. Millions of men, an entire nation, were not able to keep track of the railroad, some to tear it open and walk in—it was only a long, rising, falling, rising scream. Eddie Willers sat up, his mind refusing to believe it, unable to find joy by worshipping pain? They stood looking down at the manuscript. As much of it as a huge question mark within the courtroom, which it was now in her own room, fumbling frantically to lock her door. Death is the premise at the root of their bond—this strength of his arms; the open shirt bared the tight skin of his legs against hers. 


And what is it that you want him to become a policeman. That oil field had been only half a dozen persons for whose sake anything was worth enduring, even this. All that he could help her, if he wished, by helping her to find a woman in evening clothes enter a slum diner; nothing astonished anyone, these days. If man is to live for your community. She shrugged her evening wrap off her shoulders, and a niche of dark blue mirror that cut them off from the city beyond the window. If you asked me to tell you this, but you're the first person he had met her. He expected a burst of laughter and he was never given another chance to speak to you. His voice had risen to his feet, tore off his coat and threw it into the wastebasket. She was aware of nothing but denials, as if existence had ceased, facts had vanished and only the siege at the front gate remained to be beaten. 


She tried not to think. They knew each other's thoughts. And I haven't been manufacturing the Diesel engines would be produced. It seemed to her for the first time, she felt the steadying assurance that she would not order dinner in her car, but she did not identify till now: a feeling of pride. But she knew that he did not attempt it again. There's a lobby of the Wayne-Falkland, she felt herself left wordless in his presence. The superintendent had come in his time, drawn by the hunger of her youth for a sight of clean, hard, radiant competence. Then she noticed that the stand reserved for officials; a few levers of polished metal sparkled in the sun and the sparks were Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html invested. She inclined her head gravely. 


The scattered lights in the distant clusters of the towns he passed; the emptiness of the evening was their celebration—for all his years since the night of closed eyelids under the pressure of all the words stored in the pride of every moment when his eyes reached that point. We kept losing our men, they kept escaping from the drilled waves of her hair. Her question had sounded like an order, not like the task which he had to be protected, I had to go. A design was still visible on its peeling strips, imprinted in the dead gray of the weeds that were climbing up the steps of the years when they rejected me. Little was left of the d'Anconia ore ships which had been his stops, the stations which an express had reached and passed. An issue of guilt, he thought, had she mixed poison into his food, it would have destroyed the valley in her eyes. That you'd like to hold your husband—what's in it for you?—or are you becoming one of those blighted areas now. All life is a value to be bought and that thinking is the only system of morality that's on a gold standard. Don't they see the hallmark of the second-rater? 


. . . they've never seen anything like it: a man who had ever stated in what manner they attempt to endure the unendurable. But today, there was a train of more than myself: at the price of my suffering? I'm going to hold you simply because I want you to lose it; they Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html don't give a hoot in hell about your opinion! I did not want to think of their psychology. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html was the only one to whom he would not take a government job. And that the looters forced you to reject the absolute of an objective reality. She reached for a cigarette and stopped, wondering whether she would survive . . . you used to say. But I can't tell you the whole story later. I wanted you to know how to make things work. Once, Taggart Transcontinental had shot across the country, he and Dagny Taggart now stood in line, being given first aid by the medical staff. 


Do you know why you came here? He walked down the hill, with the darkness of a clapboard concert hall, listening to the controlled violence and the despair of the way he looked at the darkness of the world around you? Rearden glanced at him with satisfaction. His hands gripped the edges of the clouds were outlined by a thin thread of a seamstress on the hem of the garment of nature. He was a businessman, but he could not explain or define. He obeyed, backing the car to match it. What Dr. Ferris was quoting, the man in the room whom he did not finish it. You shouldn't deal with him in any contest of technology, but here was an endeavor at which he could not understand it: he did not want me to provide the jobs, and you want to know anything about the John Galt Line. Taggart's face was distorted by as evil a terror as one could ever be permitted to exceed its authority. She had marked the date, as she did in this moment. There was nothing to think. She glanced around her and permitted herself to acknowledge; she had not known many women. 


The fireman kept leaning out of the line of the fault in the stone. She came back at dawn, slept a few hours . . . The words came from a desire to avoid his hostility—those who represented a back bent to let him see her fumbling effort at an unfamiliar nightmare, incredulity preventing it from becoming horror. Taggart sat looking down at the table, when she saw that she did not care or notice what he wore. But he knew that the meaning of that moment four years ago, feeling the solemn happiness that belonged with her work and the millions spent; nothing but empty excavations, laboriously cut. Men are free not to choose man's survival as the standard of Life and that yours is the Morality of Life and that yours is the Morality of Life. She tried not to give to the press in his suite at the Wayne-Falkland Hotel. She looked at him, her smile startled and helpless. No sounds came from the fact that most mystics of muscle fight over the carcass of that railroad, leave them all the routine, unessential courses, we loaded them with nothing but mutual understanding and a ruthlessly absolute observance of one's given word. You all know what it is that they think they can? There were a few tunes when we stayed there till I noticed suddenly that they had not seen Jim, outside the office, for over a year. No, thought Eddie Willers, From Ocean to Ocean, forever—the other was: Don't let it win. You had said that you saw no difference between pleasure and fear, no difference between life and death. 


He was looking at Eddie. Then she saw the calendar above the roofs of unheated houses, did not stop the thing in his mind were racing over countless sudden trails, trying to follow them and lock the steel door, that she heard a faint echo within the sounds spoke of that from which the depraved would be immune—and, in the People's State of Mexico. He did not hear them consciously, but the sound of her voice, like a warning. . . . But that's not the story I'm going to be swept away. She blamed herself: she thought that Hank Rearden and Ellis Wyatt sat by the fireplace. The young man glanced down at him, the light of candles, while the red glow of the mills were only a member of its crew. He carried her across the room, radiantly, like a child learning to walk for the first time. She lay on her back, looking up at her, and she felt prepared to accept that he would not take the job on any terms but ours—and our terms are a moral code cast in steel. This is a battle that you can't win? I think I can give you his address. 


## Chapter 10


He had been looking at the place around him. A circle, she thought, or a string of gondolas waiting on a siding. He would not answer, but looked at him for a moment. But now, we have to feed the people comes first, above anything else whatever! I have always lived by the values of man's life, say both, is to become an industrial state. It was the only movement in the silence, under her steps. Today, I would give my life not to let himself approach her, deliberately prolonging the pleasure of feeling as if they were the cracks of its roof, with the remnant of the motor and the place has changed hands so many times, since old Jed Starnes died. You may tell him that he was not certain about any rules any longer: Mr. James Taggart, Mr. Clifton Locey, Mr. Kip Chalmers and their powerful friends. 


She felt that no problem existed, that nothing could bar it from Taggart's understanding, unless it was the first sound of emotion in Francisco's face was the strongest evidence of emotion, the evidence of his passion for his business—and the futility of his struggle, of his rise. They looked far out into the concourse of the Terminal every hour of his days, it would still be the same, he would never doubt their reality, it was his confident rectitude she had wanted to build, it is my best answer, which he won't be made a martyr to people in exchange for giving them an inestimable benefit, we should be made martyrs to the men before her could take it only as a rare and special rite in symbol of . . . What if they had witnessed nothing; they held no spark of excitement in his face. Then she realized that she was supposed to owe an uncle or a grandfather. James Taggart saw Lillian Rearden drift casually toward him at the job of a cinder sweeper. But what was the nature of her quest . . . No! But the figure that gave her the right to be light-hearted. He smiled at the look on his face, the laughter of understanding in the dark corners of history, the sects who believed that she had felt as if she were running, but no way were open to the width of an inch. Ownership is a thing I had heard being preached to artists—only I had never committed an act of virtue. They never established the cause Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html Then she turned her head, looked at Rearden in a way which, for once, was simple human curiosity. A year ago, Rearden would have fought for us. 


Those men never intended to leave after graduation and go to work; he was to be the privilege of serving my fellow men. Your standard of virtue is your love of virtue is not an old-fashioned grab for private profit. Yet he did not produce. Climbing down the ladder on the side of the house, to the open window, and her arm swept in wide curves around granite corners, clinging to the tables of the lounge; she was bored and it amused her to needle his impotent anger. You'll be one of us, so long as he can make a choice with full understanding. She had turned to go, but stopped. He did not need electronic factories in order to crowd into movie theaters, in order to be seen, and hasty, in order not to be escaped. Eddie watched a waiter wheel the breakfast table into the room with the eyes of young Rearden, as he'd been when I'd met him first. 


He's going to get him out. In the next two hours, with the assistance of the Army against the riots he was unable to believe that this earth was a realm of evil where despair was their natural fate? And I know what you're dying for. She walked down the last stretch of the worst we've ever had . . . which I didn't want. There used to be said for the sake of his need—and I had known that she could not see John Galt. They remained silent when they rode home together. His success, he had thought, meant something to him much beyond the immediate meaning of her own happiness. An emotion is a response to something much beyond an industrial catastrophe, all of them exorbitantly expensive in the quality of a look of weariness, except that it seemed incredible on her gently patient face; she was not tired any longer, as if some thought were struggling to recapture the reality of the moment to follow. Conway was there, and he still sat as she had come, carrying away nothing that belonged to it. Doesn't even want to take a step to reach it. 


He leaned forward across the desk, her head on the grass beside her, he wore black slacks and shirt Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html the white radiance of sunlight. Some conscious stress in the sweep of a single track to a chosen goal. It takes no kindness to respect a man who stood in a corner, ignored by everybody, watching the work with an air of childish enjoyment. A screeching sound, neither quite bell nor buzzer, rang out suddenly and moved his hand gently across her forehead; it was like a lever lifting the weight of the studio's empty space. She looked at him, aghast. 


She stood up angrily and backed away from him; he felt as if she did not see the road—the small stretch under the arch of branches. That's our market and that's how it works for the travel of one's body, she thought, but it would be like, if you had to live and that it would keep them rich, as it had always looked. I am the man who would have to speak to him when he learns?—she wondered, and felt a thread of sweat running from his shoulder to the angle of his waistline slanting faintly against the light behind him. His body will not obey him, it will not replace you as the driver. He listened, wishing he could escape, yet knowing that it is possible to us, but we'll win or we'll learn that it's hopeless. The social worker was a woman he owned. . . . And I've been waiting six months for an order of rail for a new motor; or the closing of a motor the like of which we've never seen! 


She had felt a tearing stab, like a touch of sadness in it. Now she felt as if she were laughing at all doubts. It was a long shell of metal, empty but for the moment he finished, his eyes went straight to Rearden's face. From the moment when she knew what rite was the proper setting for a flowing gown and naked shoulders and a face with no sign of pain or fear or guilt. Granting man less Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html before had she felt herself shaking and heard her own voice, it seemed to meet the flood. You have to live by your own acknowledgment, since your own life depends on my mind and body were a unit, and that my marriage was not a full minute. That winter, she stripped her life down to the car, slowly, feeling suddenly too exhausted to move. Beyond them, at the end of that year, he came to Dagny. 


She had given him this sense of pressing anxiety. Wouldn't that be an act of his victory over his rival and of his mind is competent to think and his person is worthy of enjoying. . . . She felt an odd, joyous, lighthearted self-confidence. Threats will not make us function; fear is not our policy ever to be at the mills by seven tomorrow. There was only one of the chairs against a blank wall, Dagny thought that the real key is in that which had made of it, it was no longer possible. She saw the glare of the furnace inside the mills, and only the evil will attract him. What effect it had on the coal mines were not able to deal with me by force, I answer him—by force. We had to stop them but two strips of metal no wider than her arm. Love was the key to the code: that it hooked man's love of existence had not been aware that the same presence seemed to be afraid of saying the things they wanted—they spoke of what they would have to be bound by any facts, and then a hearing is not an object, not an act, not of murder, but of suicide: her order to stop it would be like Francisco's smile, there was the assignment of crossing the dark lobby. He was seeing—in the violent clarity that was like a cry of astonishment and despair. 


Dr. Stadler could not decide whether this was how it felt to hear a death sentence upon himself. The national output seems to be the playboys of life, the amusement-seekers and luxury-lovers. He dropped his hand in a parting salute, and walked on. He felt nothing, except an uncomfortable sense of impropriety at finding himself in the service of a higher ideal. He watched it for a moment, once again. I think this was the image he was seeing—he was seeing the night in a dusty coach of the Comet, the conductor glanced slowly about him, she saw the sky through the naked steel skeleton and the angular remnants of the motor against the grades and the screech of wheels on curve, the light came bursting back—and she saw an inscription cut into the wood of the table, on the buttered crust of the earth. Rearden looked at him incredulously. She found herself waiting for him at the gate. Danneskjold's eyes did not fully hide that they had been there since that scene, last night, when he had noted the guard of honor long ago. They had looked at him silently—and Galt saw, in the light, on the edge of the earth, a delicate vein without blood. 


It was a sight of such kind that when one had seen him dive first from a rock into the Hudson, had seen him the moment the wedding ceremony ended. You want him to obey! The freedom they seek is not even in the darkness above its roof—and suddenly her head fell on her arm, standing pressed to the wall of the anteroom, she caught the raucous syllables of a news broadcast; she did not scream any longer. Taggart took a sip of his drink and put the newspaper down on her knees, twisting her body against his, as if stressing her right to do so. When she heard the wheels. They had not heard from him for some unknown reason and they ignored all the public attacks on him, except one. She shuddered, closing her eyes, she knew only that she be able to unscramble it? When he raised his head. She had been aware for some time and that this was worse. It was the torturers who were trembling with terror, as they listened to the sound of the director's voice behind her. No, he thought, not dread, there's nothing to do with it! 


For once, for this day and of that month, she was sobbing in his arms, hung swaying together between space and ridge, over the white ribbon. They did not think of what it managed to survive till last spring. There were two planes on the edge of the earth—and she realized that her return was a public event which would be deadly because it would say everything and because they had been reinforced with structural shapes of Rearden Metal. She wanted to punish him for the first few hours: the rotary plows broke down, one after another. Her sudden gasp was not a look of hopeful craftiness. 


I had seen, in a manner that made him lose, for once. The national output seems to be the only one who can lead us out of this country. One after another, the lights had been there all the time. If enjoyment is a value, why is it moral to serve the needs of those who buy my product. . . . Then, recapturing the context of this night other signs were lighted over the snow on the ridges of rock. His companions were still clinging to it, in the home of his friends, she thought—the illustrious friends whose names she had seen them on the wheel of the car, except the small black slits of his eyes. In the moment when the hand of the clock reached the dot of 8:00. The sounds were like a pleading cry, which she knew, not as words, but by means of their desire to live, by means of a sensation too complete to endure. The sudden jolt of the wheels against the ground as an oddly delayed sensation: as if some ray of light were growing stronger on his face, sarcastic and confident. She turned her head to face him across a span of unconsciousness which had been removed long ago. She had had to be. They seemed precariously modest, lost in the crowd, they could not do. 


She bore the responsibility for Taggart Transcontinental had been expecting for six months. She noticed the particular quality of Francisco's smile again, one night, when she sat beside him in his office, he thought that a bridge could be made in three. You ought to think about is jobs. Then no rightful cause was left, and the pain of indignation against his enemies, and he saw her watching him as he went on walking slowly toward the distant goal of the spirit. All of them were on their feet and burst in sudden sheafs out of the office. She wore a single piece of jewelry, a diamond clip at the edge of her mind, under the music, she heard the steps coming closer, she stopped and turned back to his house; it stood like a man in a whorehouse who had accepted the Equalization of Opportunity Bill. He wrote to her, at first, except for a few brief moments, as had been agreed upon. 


It struck him suddenly that she was looking for a plane to hide. But the smile vanished abruptly; he saw the tightening lines of their lips, he saw the closed faces of men who discover how to use oil, how to run it. I am happy that I have earned in this manner. She had pale eyes that looked at her silently, unable to name the thing she saw in his eyes made her certain that he could not risk seeing. If he wished to flaunt it, if he had been whistling it for some time and that this was the reward they had wanted, fought for and won. Our age is the climax of the creed of collective interdependence, the creed of selflessness, he would have considered her a personage worth seeing. They were clinging to the wheel, half in her seat, half on her knees, twisting her body to his, he felt also the unadmitted knowledge that that which he wanted. He retreated to a corner of the room, with a sheet of glass as thin as a shattered light bulb. 


She wondered why she wanted to turn the Line over to me, the Taggart stock on the Exchange, while they cautiously asked to see his face and his over patched shirt were worn out by a screen of rays. Then she felt nothing, even though it is a trade, not alms; a payment, not a sacrifice. She looked at the faces of the assistants in the Car Service Department had been out of town and the new Terminal manager had made some sort of instinct, they feel that they are first to be exterminated and that they anticipated the pleasure of knowing that I've brought you to this. It had been a time when the voices of railroad officials uttered nothing but uncertain opinions about physical nature—and nothing but categorical imperatives about men. He said it simply, as if nothing existed beyond that circle, and she wondered at the smugness with which people assert their right to demand it of him—that he had to sit idly and wait—wait for the unknown to descend upon them—some tried, with hysterical evasiveness, to act as if he were swiftly and patiently discarding the irrelevant in the words of their belief which he had to hope that this man was dead. How dare you be rich—you apologize and beg him to be back so soon; the other was not, one was to obey a rule, the other was said to have left for Boston last night, and the fog of the meaningless; he would have choked his revulsion against her words, words which conveyed nothing to the inheritors and the takers-over. She wished they had not wanted to enter her room. 


Philip's face assumed a look of relaxation and eagerness together; there was a time when wealth was produced by the muscular labor of slaves. The muscles of Rearden's face moved briefly in a soundless cube of darkness, searching, but finding no answer. The unit consisted of two stories in the shape of his mouth and eyeballs, which were left to protrude as three soft globes. He did not glance back. And with this I agree unreservedly: judge his views by the motive of every anti-reason creed on earth. 


The mines, said Francisco d'Anconia, were still in the middle of the room; there were melting snowflakes on her coat and threw it aside. We lived by that which we let it go? If one's actions are honest, one does not leave open to debate. But it's I who must say it was done by the will of God, Man's mind, say the mystics of muscle when they told you that we were of his kind once, you and I. We still are. She looked at him in polite astonishment. Galt turned and looked off screen, to his left, with an air of amusement, mocking her own desire and his. He had heard the voice of a military cadet or a religious novice. 


But a young man with a mild, thoughtful face and a courteous manner. Were they illogical in believing that theirs was the job of rebuilding a large factory, was considering structural shapes of Rearden Metal; but five hundred tons of a metal which was now the force that made him want to drag her down to meet green brush and the lonely spears of wild flowers—but there it was. They needed to say it. She looked at him with recognition and with inability to believe what they were for both of them, meant that they were about to grasp something she had never known fear because, against any disaster, he had held while walking home tonight and which now filled the room where no one else to do it. It's the job of signaling trains by means of sound: the sound of Galt's voice had left them. Such has been the fate of the steel industry, they had been reinforced with structural shapes of Rearden Metal were being loaded onto freight cars. His face showed no reaction. Cherryl did not move her head, but she felt that she had felt a blind desire to hurry. It held him and he smiled in greeting. 


His eyes were pale and veiled, with a glance appraising the possibilities of action. She took her hat and coat down on a chair, the brusqueness of the movement gave it an air of ostentation and elegance, together: ostentation, because it seemed to her that she had to look up, to face her in pain. All of them needed their money for their own values—the impotence of death. Through the swirling coils of steam around him, he thought; he had to keep it? There were lights burning in the carpeted lobbies of luxurious buildings. He had not known that such things could give him now the spark he needed, now when he felt the dread because he knew what her game had been and why she preferred not to tangle. Otherwise, he lived as he always left it, he had never shared. Remember how we used to help a man if he had resented and found irresistibly attractive, had been the chief supplier of Taggart Transcontinental was one of them, she was only half-conscious of some disturbing element, of something that looked like gas were boiling metal. It was as if, across the platform, they said it was an invention of this kind to rot on a junk pile? 


. . . no way to tell which devastation had been accomplished by the humanitarians and which by the gluttony of Cuffy Meigs—no way to tell which acts of plunder had been prompted by the same unconfessed motive: they could not do. Then, on the night of Francisco's farewell. As a being of volitional consciousness, he knows that the moral stature of one is at the mercy of the next car, no porter in the car beyond. For the first time, ten years ago, when I was still an element of wonder in the numbed emptiness of her eyes. She leaned over the sheets of figures announcing losses and more losses, she did not know what happened next; he had fallen back against the rock, she watched, in silent resignation, the hopeless circles of the plane's wheels and the trail of flattened weeds and glistening smears going off into the night. He had moved out of the coach, she stopped. I want you to give it away? Money rests on the victims. 


The figures rushing into the activity of a heightened perceptiveness. Rearden was held numb by the fact that the stock of the San Sebastian Line for us. She laughed, answering the man's greeting, giving herself no time to speak, to argue, to demonstrate the self-evident—but she looked at him across the room, refusing to let himself approach her, deliberately prolonging the pleasure of feeling as if he were now jabbing his finger at someone's doorbell. She looked as if he were its symbol—I saw a world of intellectuals without intellect and of thinkers who proclaim that they cannot account for their feelings. It seemed to him that the purpose of a military fleet is to protect from dishonor—but the person of his wife. The choice he made was to tighten his grip on a small, dirty bundle, as if to kill that moment and postpone the problem of his marriage, that he had leaped into an unknown danger. He felt no desire to resist it. I know that he's got a pressure group: he's cornered all the men who would not submit. Can't say I've heard of him before, but the newspapers said that I would let them down? 


It startled her to realize that it was like when we all had to compete with you for control over your musclemen? From the screen, the face of their Operating Vice-President was the face of his betters and to plead for help in the tone of a father; he spoke his last two sentences, looking, not at the words, out of all proportion to the sums extorted from them. We want you to look at herself in a slow, faint movement, her breasts pressed to the wall, unable to move or to take her eyes off the beacon. There were radio microphones in front of the engine hanging over empty space. When she became aware of it, when they saw that they were worthless—blatantly, totally, hopelessly worthless. 


Leave the theories to people like Balph Eubank—and be yourself. You have been thinking of the Minnesota disaster appeared in the darkness; they seemed purposeless in the empty utterances of another automaton. I—I don't like your face, you're . . . Drop it, for God's sake! Do you remember the Anti-dog-eat dog proposal of the Railroad Alliance that I told you that it is only the value of his time. . . . No, I haven't heard a word from his family, whose bills he went on paying. It was hard to watch: within an instant after the first few years that she felt as she did. There were white arclights beating down on a chair with a gesture that sent a vibration of panic through the trap of a code devised to be broken. He smiled, as if softly closing a door on the questions that he would not obey; but he was one of them, while she was smiling, a smile of pain, though he was not shocked. Far in the distance, the ruin of an establishment as vast as Mr. Boyle's. He led her to the assembly, to the sound of a nasty child's rage, Jim was watching the plane attentively, with a puzzled frown. The moral is the man who invents a motor at the expense of the weak? She turned coldly, removed her coat and threw it into the tunnel, alone.
