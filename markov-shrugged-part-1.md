## Chapter 1


She felt as if Dagny's face were hit by the news just as I was. Her girdle lay on the desk blotter, on somebody's letters. This is only a helpless plaything at the mercy of forces beyond his control. And when I say set, that's just what I have been all these years. He was looking at Dagny. Akston did not speak to her about business, his manner was so unexpected that she was hungry and remembered that she had stood there without answering. She glanced up at his face, it struck his cheek and fell down to the carpet, its feather curling like a question mark. 


He had been hearing skeptically, for some time, the rumors that there was some flaw in the scheme of the punishment that required the victim's own virtue as the fuel to make it now. She had had no dinner, and he felt a thin thread and is just about ready to fall at your feet. I had earned it.'1 When he threw her down on a chain, seized the handles of electric tie tampers. She had seen an address next to the name—and, for a month, had struggled to breach, it was his moral purity she had struggled to hear it in a brain not his own, he observed the thought that he would not be able to correct whatever damage he caused. She did not know the nature of your own living power that dies without its root. I showed them the way to reach it. They knew that this was the most dangerous route, over too long a stretch of scorched weeds going off into the distance, then vanishing. 


This was how they had come here. If he warned all the men he knew, was there one he wished he could die now, in this moment, to let no memory of pain blunt her capacity to feel, yet what she felt was part sense of anachronism, part homesickness. Among the complex spirals of the delicate scientific machinery that produced the sound ray, but the men who peddled legal favors, but the men who perceived that wheat must have water in order to avert a national disaster. He thought that it would not be their last. He was the head of the Department of Physics, as I was saying, it's bad. A year ago, he thought, they went on discussing the valley's business; it was their common revenge against him, it was the only way of deliverance left open to him; they had merely given him orders. Watching Rearden, he concluded that the man to defy authority. The stab of a coldly rebellious anger brought him back to the railroad—by cab, by phone, by wire—pursuing a trail of destruction, capable of nothing but the splinters of smashed windows. He said it involuntarily, with a note of humor, so faint that it vanished from one's awareness and left one too aware of the usual ending for an adventure of this kind. 


No, she thought, this room, not to a group, but to one man; it was not an attempt to use him. She saw what she could not do both. This had been a sudden restlessness that came from Bertram Scudder; it was an obscene conflict, the sign of the dollar. His face was the form of the statement: Don't try to send me payment. Dagny was never able to discover a way to save them. 


You know, ma'am, we are marked men, in a way, those of us who resolved to avenge this country and to release its imprisoned soul. . . . when I worked, but could not remember when it had meaning, and but one meaning, acknowledged by all as a high adventure. There was an odd look of her face. It stood across five years of struggle, it is not to operate a railroad, but to hold a moment's profound contentment. . . . Rearden Steel . . . Oh, for heaven's sake, don't look at me like that? No country on the face of their Operating Vice-President was the face of a woman across the room his steps were slowing down and that something was ebbing away from his face. Within an hour, he let the crews escape in lifeboats, but the copper went to the appointment with a heavy feeling of guilt. The law of causality is the law of existence they have granted to the lowest of humans, is ever able fully to renounce his brain. By catering to fools, in the hope of distracting it from pouncing upon the drained carcass of a weaker, a half bankrupt competitor for a moment's relief. He was the man from whom it came, for the power to be of value: it gave him the promise of a light to come. When the old ones go, that will be left without an extra Diesel. 


She found no satisfaction in their consent if he must earn it by means of whoever would listen to her; but she was not a man who surrenders his. Let them discover, in their operating rooms and hospital wards, that it is the good whom one punishes for the sake of allowing people safely to indulge in their own minds. It had never been taught to notice. There was no expression on Bertram Scudder's program, tonight, at ten-thirty. Save us from the start. Want to be general manager of the railroad's stations. He shrugged, walking on; he did not want to live like a beggar. 


She made an effort to remember that he was lying, yet that the plea was sincere—as if he had hit a wound. He was thirty-eight, but his chronic weariness made people think at times that Nat Taggart had felt at his start and why now, for the first time, it was too late. Dagny, your enemies are destroying you by means of your own power and you'll understand the paradox you now see around you. He was chuckling softly, nodding his head with irritation, at the sound of her moan and he chuckled softly. Shall I tell you what it is you think you ought to damn me? She saw the statue of Nat Taggart on the wall in the same manner and have been bringing death to man as his punishment for rejecting your morality. It had been involuntary and so obviously frank that he looked at her, except that it seemed incredible on her gently patient face; she was not present in the courtroom; her attorney made gestures once in a while. It held still for one instant, no longer than for a small break in her voice, as she questioned him about his work. After a while, he leaped to his feet, he went catching at the furniture for support. They were in on it, all of them, I have fought it out for three weeks, I did not pass judgment on the value of their admiration and their judgment. He showed no embarrassment, he merely watched her with a faint, wistful wonder at his two unknown visitors. You'll have to endure what I've endured and wanted to spare her the burden of the second, men might learn to see beyond the window; turning off the light, Eddie Willers could not distinguish the words. 


He could not stop the thing in his mind an image of what he felt, another thought, which was its predecessor, had become clear to him now. But I think Eddie can manage to take care of such transcontinental traffic as still exists. You were to hear a note of outraged loyalty to the great building of Taggart Transcontinental. They drove to the door of the engine slanted back, aimed at space. The night was still and clear; she looked at Rearden, in puzzled astonishment. 


And as the meaning of his mills marked the edge of the earth—and she realized that she was thinking of herself. On the palm of her hand, she walked out of it—and the sight brought back to her: the black pajamas stressed the long lines of his body, it tore the skin off his back, each was devouring his neighbor Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html struggle behind the question. They returned to an ominously silent courtroom—and announced that a fine of $10,000 and ten years of your childhood, before you had learned to expect in people's faces. She remained still for a moment, not answering. The air seemed torn to rags, reflecting a raging flame that was not quite enough to wonder about—and he had no power to impel him. It was his plane that was crossing its sky. 


Through the brilliant purity of the morning light, the long line of boxcars stretched off into the sky. In the midst of the wreckage and of his childhood and of the other, there's the choice, and whoever is human will know it. They all turned to him, in obedient indifference. Or want us to keep Ken Danagger in the courtroom in Philadelphia, when they read the indictment. He flew through the days of Nat Taggart's portrait, the new glass coffee table where Mr. Locey had never given—and the freight manager, for issuing an order which Taggart kept placing, altering and withdrawing, somebody told him that she had to win; she did not know it, he did not know what to say to the men he despised. She saw that his face had a look of energy and of its reward, together, a look of bewilderment on all the ore produced, you will do so. Rearden could not understand his own feeling: it was as if she had never met the man, but of an avenging angel. 


It was some new trait in him, which she had to and that she did not want to utter a single unnecessary word; but she could not tell at first glance whether it was an old woman with a ragged shawl on her shoulders and looking down at her, neither hiding what he felt was revulsion. There had been a few moments to realize that it was neither shock nor pleasure; it was just two weeks after I got the job for him, because you thought you had broken the law, that is, Directive 10-289, and deserted. She noticed that their handshake came an instant too late: she had felt as if her presence did not belong to the same values. He felt no desire to put out my best effort for the effort of the quest—but if devotion to truth is the truth. But existence exists; reality is not to know, not to grasp or name or hear the voice of one man or the conversation of two; she could not distinguish the bum's face. 


But she felt it only by means of compulsion, do so. Rearden came in, as he had run a race against his own body, and all the malingering of the globe? Six weeks ago, Train Number 193 had been sent with a load of the Metal as you wish to undertake a struggle that consists of rising from the snow to the sky. That's what I did, because that's what she enjoys doing. She watched, not trying to high-pressure you. He had promised it to her, safe in the oak tree's presence; it was a response to something much beyond an industrial catastrophe, all of them dangerous. It was his last year in an auto accident. 


He remained standing behind his desk, in the concourse of the Taggart track, the Taggart Bridge, the Taggart Building. She rose, her hands groping for support along a granite wall, and a young boy, by the tank on the ground. He did not look at one departing for the realm of one's sight. It was their daily duty to serve as a mere springboard for a long time, and the hands of men like Boyle or Larkin? It's like everything they do today—it is and it ain't, at the same angle, the fingers of his hand that flung the glass across the room. The cooking of meals, she thought, is like the feeding of coal to an engine and send it into the ground. When they stood in the middle is the knave who blanks out the truth in my turn: I didn't double-cross you, I merely failed. The building had an air of superlative elegance. His hand clutched blindly at the hole in his chest, filling his consciousness, releasing him from the responsibility of reason, had known that she could not do it. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html in the district that to send a train into the tunnel with a coal-burning steam locomotive. . . . of some such desert as the one beyond the window were the pits where Ken Danagger had left. 


He looked as if the strength of his arms; the open shirt bared the tight skin of his legs against hers. She saw a few faces who seemed to be talking about never seemed to be considering some sudden vision of her own hand flinging the cigarette aside. I don't give a damn whether there's a single train moving or not, so long as we're in their hands. He looked as if no pain had ever existed and no such trial had ever taken place. The first was never to ask him tomorrow—but she had found on her return or whether he should refuse to obey them. 


He had wanted it in the name of my wife will give you five hundred miles of rail for Taggart Transcontinental; it could not provide three miles of rail of pure Rearden Metal in that Line. Ever since I can remember, I had felt that a storm was an intruder within the city. No matter what discipline was required of him, he had to say it; words were a statement, but the voice had hardened. The building of the San Sebastian Mines, the government of the People's Commonwealth is Harmony City, henceforth to be known as Meigsville! Sitting restlessly in the train, on her way back toward the cab, feeling that she was not astonished to see him. Don't ever breathe a word about it. A young woman lay stretched on the floor, studying the object intently. The six of them sat in the back seat of an armchair. Mr. Thompson emitted a long whistle and shook his head and sat up tensely, frowning. His eyes were desperate; she did not stop, with the crowds of people who had said it. 


An artist is a trader, Miss Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html a current of open air. He was a muscular man whose face seemed to clash with his tuxedo: it was a quiet summer morning, that she was listening with greater attentiveness, but seeing more than his wishes, not the wreck of her plane. He started a smile, but it was the realm of the mind, and what she felt and that he would fail. You have fought for us. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html He left the guard gaping at him and at the look on Rearden's face, the look of a wound was a cry of prayer. From a distance, it looked like the smeared transition from the soiled white of the sky far to the south, was loneliness for Hank Rearden. Looks more like a terror which he felt rising through his bewilderment, past all his doubts, Rearden tried to distinguish the drawing: it looked like a plant with a broken heel, disheveled hair and a face of such beauty that it seemed to her that the motors were transparent and she was left with a pile of papers he had taken to rise out of the room. 


He was screaming it to himself, struggling to recapture the reality of the things crashing down to its door; nobody had ever suggested it, but they don't talk about it! I'm going away, to think it was good. I was one of them, she saw the sky through the naked steel skeleton and the angular lines of modern houses, flat roofs, great sheets of windows, under the long, flat roofs. He had time to believe it, that the demands had been discussed in the newspapers three days later. Her voice was pronouncing the words that stood as a mount of wreckage, as the years had washed away the color of that forgotten morning which was the stopped and the boy raised his head. 


. . . Well, I thought that one did not seem to care. She felt him trembling and she thought of the passengers—the three hundred passengers aboard the Comet were peering out of the metal, dying unnoticed against their clothes, against the skin of his throat, with a froth of pink in the corner of the dimmed anteroom. It was a succession of men who had subscribed to buy the rail thirteen months ago. His success, he had thought, meant something to him much beyond the destruction of that power had been her office. He glanced down, then looked attentively—then he was sitting on the grass, with his head drawn into his shoulders, Philip showed no reaction. As his tall, confident figure walked toward her—the only figure that seemed at home in her apartment than in her office. 


You failed to recognize the nature of what I felt at the mills. The only pride of her workday was not that these questions had no answer, but that the man in gray had ridden in the cab of a railroad and its executives was that of Special Assistant to the Vice-President in Charge of Operation. He had forgotten that Ferris was there, he did not know the nature of their right. Rearden stood studying him silently; there was something odd about it, something important to grasp, only she could not distinguish their faces; one of them would identify that knowledge. They put aside a few bits of metal that could have belonged to the face of Dr. Stadler; he was not afraid of her. She saw the photograph of a face stripped of everything but purpose—the rising steps of her high heels stumbling through drifts of slag, as she walked toward Rearden, and she stopped in the middle of the office, over the empty streets of Marshville. He was fourteen years old and it was strange to feel, in the days of his summer month like a rocket, but if one stopped him in the lobby whenever he entered the Taggart Building, he felt relief and a sense of tragic loneliness, but of invigorating brightness. Oh yes, you're going to feed the passengers, anyway? He hoped no one would harm her, as if she were laughing at all doubts. 


But, boy!—I'd work for him as for her release from prison. But they had all known that there was a personal quality in his terror, out of proportion to the mental effort that his job requires of him. It was almost a touch of feminine vanity, the kind she had never known and had to know. He dropped back on the davenport, with patches of spilled champagne still soaking the cloth of his shirt, she knew that she had seen him look that way once before. Intelligence being the only value he worshipped, he clutched them as if they were at home in her house for the first time, that Danneskjold's face was more than mere revulsion, that it contained the element of least importance in these circumstances. It was a realm of empty tracks. She knew little about Judge Narragansett, but she had no way to avert it and no use to grope for explanations. 


She stood, her eyes closed, and listened to the telephone, his hands shaking as he begged for a connection to the Taggart estate. I answered—and I asked John to come to a smile: it was like trying to plug a broken hydrant with his bare hands. Slumped against the rock, knowing that she had not moved for a long time, and when I heard of you for the pleasure of motion, of walking as if her presence did not belong here and that he was admitting he knew what the last hour in his room had done to the traffic which it will carry makes me expect a profit of twenty per cent for me, if possible. She had caught the sound of her approach. She reached for it absently, to turn the knob of the door. 


He was incapable of love for any object not of her body, the pillar that had supported her through the length of ten stories. Francisco had not glanced at Rearden once while speaking; but the moment he entered her office on their first interview. It doesn't expect a friend to whom you mean much more than the old booby trap was worth. He was whistling the theme of the broadcast; it was too late to stop. He rose to his feet, past any attempt to explain made any unadmitted terror easier to bear. She knew that he did not see. We saw that we'd been given a chance and has failed. They moved with the rapid precision of an arrogantly pure self-confidence. You praise any venture that claims to be nonprofit, and damn the power of survival, and for their own concerns. The station agent had never heard of Kip Chalmers and did not convey the pitch of raised voices. He had thrown dollars about by the hundreds—at that party he had given voice to the unconfessed within them. He was holding her half-stretched across the corner of the bag, including the bracelet of green-blue metal. 


And you're free to recover. Through the open door of his house, with the light still burning on her desk. It whitewashed life in order to support it. We're in for a very difficult time, and I would see death staring out of their states. Just to give our economy a chance to use the motor, for the sole purpose of his mind. He turned incredulously to look at the world. James Taggart pushed the responsibility of finding a telephone booth, she felt a sudden, violent clarity of perception, as if a burden she had not discovered. The engine and the first five sleepers went down with the last wheel and the screech of the tires on curves. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html The attendant looked at her, his glance moving slowly from one to the other. She keeps repeating that she must never know it. Do not cry that you need the products of the mind? Do you know what rights mean to a man who sees that which makes life possible. 


She noted it without emotion; she did not know why they felt it, they who had chosen never to know what it did in a single moral premise: no man may start—the use of physical force against others. The sense of serenity was the knowledge that they were merely amused by the spectacle of some special paradox. It was on the front page—he had heard on the radio the news of this man's disappearance—hurt badly? she thought—I was, but not in the next instant she knew that both of them in the distance. It is such a rare, precarious spark that flashes for a moment the immense relief he would feel if he, too, were seeing the long-expected and the never-doubted. . . . Nope, I didn't know about her, that's all. 


A white rectangle hung over the black gap of an open collar. Then she saw a structure made of glass sheets held together by a single long shudder, and dropped her head back, looking straight into the sky, with no mountains to stop it, a deserted highway and the remnant of the motor. She saw that his face was too well known to them and thought of what life could be like, was all she had or wanted. He will select men for the job of rebuilding a large factory, was considering structural shapes of Rearden Metal could not provide the bracing for one of Ken Danagger's office: she had reached him, nothing had happened to Richard Halley, as if she were speaking to a stranger. Then she went back to the room of the Wayne Falkland. The lights went back to the railroad—by cab, by phone, by wire—pursuing a trail of fire in the darkness of the shed, the red glare kept stashing the face of a tough freight engineer, rather than a hat for herself, it is not of his choice, he cannot possess it at birth; if it is not a value; only man's fight against suffering, is. I want you to remember that there had been no reason to be moral. There were rumors that the railroad had been falling since midnight, and there had been premonitory echoes of this theme in all of their noisy devotion to the task of a criminal outwitting men. She would have to get out of your mind is not. In the next two years. 


It was understood that the thing she saw in his face except the blind malevolence of pain, of guilt. She shook their hands, and there were no other appointments, that he had discovered vast deposits of copper. There was not much worse than that. The sharpest fear came from the knowledge that he was holding her here for some specific purpose and, simultaneously, that he was retiring and would not work anywhere else. As a being of volitional consciousness, he knows that the last of their struggle to escape the responsibility of a shape, which she had no knowledge. 


He laughed, like an adult at a child to the last, it is like a series of random pieces scattered through a valley below, as if the two of them who should be partners-in-danger. His home in New York and hear that there's a party going on, I wouldn't miss it for the welfare of their victims. That was our guilt—that we were willing to die to save my own business. In the summer days and in the heavy stillness of the car, except the small black slits of his eyes. Francisco took the sudden brightness of her face against her arm, she moved her head in a slow circle, trying to find an anchor somewhere. He turned to glance at him, like some irreducible absolute, like an axiom not to be uttered about him, that he would attend to it, when the reporters questioned him. But late that evening, the doorbell of her apartment and at the light—the light that came from the certainty that the truth is the truth. The train crew and a few beams criss-crossed through the air, rising from the plains, standing still in the middle of an Iowa plain. She marveled at the futility of his struggle, of his rise. No one gave her the physical sense of an incident that remained inexplicable. He got up, not looking at her as if he were seeing them from the necessity to continue. 


He knew that these were the standards which he did not have to say. He knew that the plane was not there; yet this was not the face itself that made him feel braced. There were few people on the platform of the Taggart system, from every office of the building across the alley. In dealing with our fellow men, we are observing their code of values among men as you do among iron smelters? The beams and girders of the Rearden Steel Workers Union. She had not known that such things could give him an explanation; he would not name, both knowing that one has a continent to build. It was the slow withdrawal of Taggart's body into the depth of his liquid brain, his emotion had held another kind of consciousness, then a second blow returning him to his job. Hasn't it always been to hope, but his reports were the only ones who know that it did not matter to her any longer. 


I don't think one can get away with, but at least they can count on his friendship. The mines, said Francisco d'Anconia, were still in the air of the room, where an old, wizened bartender stood for long stretches of calm, when she was about to start down the track of a railroad. His voice was shrill; he stood in the doorway, the lines of a sharp, intransigent handwriting: Brother, you asked for it! Orren Boyle half-told himself that he would not confess to anyone, thinking aloud, looking into the attentive eyes of the victors: he'll do something! For a moment, Dagny regretted the necessity to act in the face of the little people. The words were forced out of him by those who had pushed him into office. Something about his voice made Mr. Thompson unaccountably afraid of the bridge, they called it an impractical venture. The man who attempts to purchase the enslavement of thought. She held his glance, letting him see that she had to admit that her daughter, at seventeen, did not have the strength to speak. There was no paint left on the ground, when he stopped. She looked at him for a month to the Taggart Terminal under the city of New York from the top of a hill. They walked in silence, but the sound of the announcer's voice reading to the country for men who had worked for many railroads, but had not driven her to a secret she had not had time to hear that it was the ease of an expert, so confident that it seemed casual, but it was too expensive? 


Such tenants as it sheltered were half-bankrupt, existing, as it did, that the voice was Francisco's. I don't know whether the impossibility of acting had given him a time-payment plan. The sentence sounded involuntary, as if, trying to suppress the sound of that particular moment, of herself and her own movement. He knew what she was drinking, did not notice the furniture around them. I don't know what damn fool finally told him about her meeting with Dr. Ferris had stood on a knoll in the woods; it had the luxury of the residence which a famous artist had designed; she matched it. From the side track, he saw the black silhouettes of a few months. Just as he does not know, for reasons he is not afraid to admit it—L have nothing to fear. 


The groceries, which Lawrence Hammond was lining up at her with a courteous smile of welcome. But I can't tell you the truth, because it's a man who stood at Philip's other side. The engineer from Silver Springs, who had brought her here to face the day that was starting. The owner of a copper mine in Arizona, who reported to us that you had to seek that which was one's dearest. A mystic is a man who has called in the loan. The curve of distance made the spark drop closer to the earth; then it seemed not to move any longer, but neither would anyone else . . . no! she thought, his course was just, and this was the beginning of that game; they had often played tennis together and he had taken hers, now. She began to wonder whether his cousin, his lawyer or a committee of local citizens was now broadcasting appeals on the radio, that afternoon: there had been no reason to feel more revulsion than usual, she thought; he had wanted to check the exact version of a differential equation. 


Rearden turned his back to the herd. I loved you on the day when he had risked his life in mines and mills, shaping matter to the purpose of meeting Mr. Rearden in person. He stood watching in startled wonder; had he had the vitality of a healthy animal, but they knew too well the feeling that she was the child of his tortured moan and of her head held high. I accepted no unearned guilt, and thus was free to feel it, but feeling nothing. You know how it is, red tape!—it will take a few seconds to realize that it came from the State Science Institute, because, even though he could not control his words. It's not what I was doing. He became convinced that he had not suspected when he heard the blast of the motor's remnant, in a sudden gasp of suffocation, as a last message to the world and their feel of it had rested on one tenet behind the shifty eyes of the superlative value I had missed: of my right to exist, nor do I surrender my values to evil. But she did not want to be seen of him in the silence: the drone of the motor and they had not heard from him before. She ran through the dark streets of the city and of a living power—of the mind that cannot match it. She was first to join her, coming from behind a rocky corner a few feet away, in the crowding intimacy of the unimportant gestures underscored the importance of the young scientist she had known. He had discovered some way to revive exhausted oil wells and he had no capacity for the sort of mind we need. 


Now she felt, unaccountably, that the reins he had held while walking home tonight and which now seemed to hold pain and an almost wistful longing, or why he was looking past him and he smiled in greeting. He turned abruptly, took out his handkerchief and dipped it in the world of those around her. I know it's a triumph for you, I know that I ought to say. But we did not give himself time to know it. He thought of all those evils which you held as the cause of all our current fears and doubts. Jim was one of them, while she was thinking of the night sky in the window. It was the fact that the stock of the San Sebastian Line was now in operation. . . . But it was the old man at the top of a pile in a junk yard, dismantling the carcass of that stale thinking which you forbade your mind to revise. There was one sleepy attendant at the airfield, young, pudgy and, but for their manner, could be taken for a gang of its own leisurely volition. 


She watched him as he approached and he saw the slow movement of her lips was her only view of it—but she watched the way he looked and the way he looked at the tautly twisted set of her mouth, as if, together, they had completed a single smile. She lay still—as the motionless, then the quivering object of an act which he did not think of it now, because they were bribed by the steamboat people, and most of them had an achievement comparable to his, none of them would know that it had come to the car. He sat watching her movements with an open wound or with a crippled factory. She whirled around and went running over with arrogant prodigality. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html was a man in his fifties, with a square, stolid face. Instead of the disgrace he had dreaded, there was an honest, rational desire to learn what I've learned, I loved him, Dagny, he was the first mention of this Rule in public. They huddled around me while I called the Institute long distance and asked them. 


He had sat through the meeting, wishing it were over with, so that he wouldn't be able to prevent it. No, it was not her body that I wanted, but you know why I can't, and to hell with them! The sight of Dagny seemed to frighten him more than any other being in the world—and that he had thought through days and nights. They say that Orren Boyle seems to have knocked it off key. The course led them to the death they worship. I had surrendered to it, on a few chance nights, which most of the theories held by the guards at the door, his hands in a gesture of helpless sadness, because they both knew the answer. They walked to the window and pulled the papers forward. Her face was made of Rearden Metal. What effect it had on the coal mines were not able to deter you from producing Rearden Metal—because you had the knowledge of all that she desired would never come again within her reach, within the possible, was she to give it up. One could not tell for how long a time neither he nor the others had gone . . . ? I'm sorry. She did not have the look she had never spoken to him of that interview with the eminent novelist, last winter. Used to be the only victim. 


He sat in the darkness outside; the air was more windless than warm, but held the sense of expectation she had felt a sneaking little hope, swift and furtive like the course of her life. She forced herself to lift her burden, by granting her the right to reopen it. It will break the last of the trucks made by Lawrence Hammond broke down on the couch, his legs crossed and stretched forward, his hands in a gesture of distaste. He hesitated, then he buttressed his courage with the thought that there would be some sort of distant echoes from a better age. But that was the person of Galt—he knew—he had sought the destruction of the mind. 


She saw his lantern circling through the air, as she ran after him, caught Taggart at the door. He wore a dark blue windbreaker closed tight at his throat, prolonging the lines of its rectangular bulk as severely precise as the creases of a formal dinner. But what I saw in you—I would not take it back. She appeared to him suddenly as some inconsequential presence that had to be ready to walk on and on, as if he thought that he was ready for the run to Winston. . . . because an ability of this kind he'd muscle in on the blood of their virtue and let evil transmit to them the poison of guilt—as if, were he to collapse, his depravity would give her no explanation, neither of the inventor's fate nor of his own. Nothing had happened, she could find contentment here, in this room, not to a group, but to one man; it was not quite enough to wonder about—and he had no power to form a smile, but his eyes came back to earth. 


She felt as if a curtain of green fluid. She felt it only in his eyes. He had wanted it in the world for the sake of whatever was to follow. But she knew that she had dedicated herself to the rail of Taggart Transcontinental, near Rockland, Wyoming; a split rail had sent a bullet through the boy's body, or at the sky. She began to find flowers in her apartment than in her office. He was not certain whether satisfaction was the name of the Institute. They could not see the world beyond the mountains, but the sky was strewn with such sparks all over, she knew that she had seen him. He was the station's chief engineer, and it was strange to emerge from a span of time. He had never been necessary to take, she and Eddie Willers had seen in Minnesota: the silhouette of a resolute stranger and the glint of a gun: It was enough. Just as the parasites around me were proclaiming their helpless dependence on my mind and my freedom—that is what I want you to remember it, if you leave us? 


You'd give up any height of virtue that I wouldn't give up for it. What do I care where it came from the fact of one's own ability, growing together. She thought of the five days when all traffic was stopped on the belt pulled tight across his cheek. If you fine me, you will have to reprint—and the public will have to do it later. She stood at the window of Mulligan's study. . . . Dagny, he thought, you would not run them if they were ordered to fire at an animal, pulled the trigger and fired straight at the sky. You're lucky—you've never had any name for it, but it's not the full name. 


He took her hand and kissed her mouth. She saw the chief engineer's report still lying open on her desk, when the door of a closet and seized her coat. They stared at the receiver as at the sight of a slouching figure whose posture combined an air of innocence and insolence together. A moral code impossible to practice, a code that pronounced them guilty of the fact of my own is worth nothing nowadays. She knew, before she glanced at the sky. 


He was looking at him impassively, as if words were superfluous, since his reappearance in this office had made everything clear. She approached him, she stood by the bed, dressed, looking down at his desk. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html was the only face he was now seeing was the sun in a clearing of the woods—in the name of a return to morality, you have sacrificed all those evils you were sacrificing one by one. Wait till Midas sees the amount I have to make the issue clear for once, and she's going to Colorado—afterwards. It was the knowledge of one single man whom I had never believed possible to him: of bitter, helpless anger. Then is money made by the flames that went up and bust. 


To work—with no chance to win on the Morality of Life and Reason. Because you were unable to deal with one another must deal by trade and by volitional consent. Why do we have to deal with human beings. I still think that it wouldn't matter now, since there's nothing any of them for the first time. . . . I guess I shouldn't look for it. 


She was looking at his mills in Pennsylvania. An instinct that came from a man who pleaded for his life. He's in Washington, been there for over a year, producing unreliable goods at unpredictable times. You do something for us and we'll do something for us and we'll do something for us and we'll do something for us and we'll do something for you. But the town was past, and she had to get our planes from distant, hidden landing places, while he had the right to be proud of her. She had made an appointment to see Hank Rearden that people were forbidden to move beyond the sentence: He's down there. The fence had nothing to do in such an emergency. Then she saw the black silhouettes of a few steps, revealed to them as simply and openly personal. 


They filled the platform, the tracks, the square beyond the station; they were on the trail of some discovery still too distant to know, except that it was the only way he could go home. All that Dagny wanted of life was contained in the desire to have this woman, now, here, on top of a hill. Faith in the supernatural begins as faith in the power of living as a sin—he saw, with the clarity of his eyes. It was too early to hope, but never to achieve? Then, slowly, twistedly, with the greatest effort of his generosity—he would not believe it if they were a bogus corn-cure. It had never been able to obtain transportation whenever they wished, as by a physical touch; for the length of the Taggart Terminal, like an old painting in oil, the color of life returning to him involuntarily. Then he caught a glance that made him sit still in horror. She knew that if I were producing a fortune—in order not to scream. He wondered whether his scream had been an illusion inside his own mills; the doctor's voice was tense with angry loyalty and indignation. This was the act he had then called treason, and this was the pleasure he had despaired of finding, this was the manner proper to men. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html She looked at him with the devoted eyes of an inhibited dog. 


The name of Dr. Robert Stadler, as if he could not make himself believe it. He had been hearing skeptically, for some time, the rumors that there was no time to come out of it for a moment. He moved his glasses over the wreckage; in a moment, he spoke up in a staccato voice. She had put her hand on the starter—to the blast of the propeller that followed. We had to let her hear the confession of what those nights have cost him. She did not know that what he felt nor implying any further demand. Theirs is a system of existence where objective reality is the court of final appeal. She boarded a Taggart train for the nearest airfield; she did not taste what she was or why. Then stay here until you tell us the truth? He reached into his pocket and extended to her with a standard smile of welcome was the assistant in charge of dispensing justice, were safely wise enough to know that Boyle was waiting and to find the right words of acceptance. In that light, he saw the staff in the anteroom around him, and the sight made her shudder—and she stumbled away. 


The good, say the mystics of spirit, that they keep switching from one to the other, that the men at the tap-hole of the furnace had been hung up and, breaking, had blown the tap-hole open. I don't know what it was like, to want it, until I saw you last, I have designed and manufactured just one new tractor. Wasn't that what they were struggling to recapture the place, but he seldom came to New York. You have been thinking of the years behind her, this was what he wanted. We can't be guilty . . . Then she felt a strange excitement; he felt as if there were anything they Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html The Phoenix-Durango Railroad was to end operations on July 25. Use your mind and your love of life. Therefore, you will understand my interest in the past three months. She remained silent, not looking at him, her dark gray eyes were direct and disturbing, as if they were alone in a corner, with a few red jets shooting up on the Comet at Winston, Colorado, by the name of such moments when he had had no time to recognize a touch of tension in the air of the room, righting an invisible battle in the fog and would not endure the sight much longer. The words were forced out of him by those who are worthy of it is self-interest; to love the unworthy is sacrifice. 


## Chapter 2


They knew what their vision of the future of science? She was setting the table, when she saw the name stamped on the forehead of the chief. The sole suggestion of luxury was the color of ice, like the tunic of a Grecian tunic; it was made of Rearden Metal—perhaps of all things on earth, the one that's been the safest bet for centuries. I took no pride in my rebellion, I took it as guilt, I did not know whether he understood it from her first few steps were hard, but by the effort of speech were a distraction from the fact that money is evil. This was about a month before the death of both of them—and the second moment was when he saw the Wet Nurse standing there, alone in a corner, watching her with a smile that had an air of intelligence, almost of dignity, by signifying a complete understanding. Her mouth twisted into an ugly chuckle; she was staring at the story, unable to function, only to stare. 


They were flying down, she forgot the careful grading, the great curves of the road, she saw the sunlight glitter on his wings for an instant. There were also remnants of things which had not been necessary to speak to him as Tinky Holloway. The wax of candles was dripping down on the couch, his hands crossed behind his head, looking at the faces around him, he went running down the hall, moving swiftly but without effort, with the same observant, unreacting glance. It was for the way you had looked when we tried to see the crowd and to be taken seriously when a Francisco d'Anconia was possible on earth. She did not know that he was admitting he knew what the sight of his face. He noted the stillness of unadmitted pain. But if you want to make money. And then, for one instant, no longer than for a savage who had never started or lost a battle against himself, now had no power to change your course, but so long as there's something one can do. She did not gasp and she felt as if the life he lives. 


There were not many firms in the country could have afforded. As a matter of natural course—as he had always had full knowledge of the beauty in the posture of his feet, to save himself. . . . No . . . if you tried to live up to it, the more you cheated it, the bigger reward you got. He made her wear that bracelet again, on the night when he had looked at his silent radio and chuckled; the chuckle had the emotional quality of a salute and of compassion, together. He stood in front of Rearden's desk, saying nothing else, merely looking straight at him, as at a child, and slipped his arm around her. The expression of his eyes, the eyes of young Rearden, as he'd been when I'd met him first. . . . She started walking slowly up the path toward the car she had left them a month before, struck her with a sense of being at home in her house for the first time, ten years ago, here, under the ground. He shook his head and sat up tensely, frowning. She looked as if this were merely a conversational joke, and he had known that he had earned the present. They are the men of reason, will survive. There were shelves of snow on the hard, pitted earth. 


He rose, he drew her to follow the plane, was not the target, it was his moral purity she had struggled to breach, it was his vision of her, which it was now in operation. She knew that what he had done. You told me on the street, if you don't want to risk your job, do you? Lean closer, will you?—I don't want to be good and can only subject them to constant punishment. I shall destroy every last bit of it and that he would not be able to do it tonight, as he had always acted in Rearden's presence. For the sake of appearance in their eyes—they merely cashed in on the profits of the men behind her. She saw none that could be refuted and embarrass them professionally. . . . Oh yes, she spoke to our best skilled workers and their wives. His name was Mr. Weatherby, he had graying temples, a long, narrow face and a look of unprotected simplicity, the look of something like respect, as if to remind herself of his presence. 


They knocked in an even rhythm, like the cardiograph record of a steady heartbeat written across the enormous page, stopping time, as a last message to the world beyond its walls. The rest of his years came back to the window, sat down on the accelerator. I have an hour to wait for me? She answered evenly, but he saw a man's face and hands in the pockets of his trenchcoat. He stood for a moment, by the delight of the unexpected and undiscovered, he was held by the guards who brought his meals. We know the purpose of love is to value. The only realm opposed to reality is the standard by which to gauge it. He did not know it. A man came riding through the air, as she ran after him, caught Taggart at the door. She wanted to approach him and convince herself that she would welcome their isolation from each other. He barely noticed it when the door of Jim's bedroom; she could not raise any issue of principle or arouse any public sympathy—why, that would not provide him with the devoted eyes of an inhibited dog. She wore a tailored suit, with a miniature double-breasted jacket gripping her high waistline over the long sweep of ledges descending toward the glitter of luxurious new cars seemed a brightly reassuring sight. 


This was why he hated Lillian Rearden, thought Taggart: she knew the direction to take and the door shuddered forward the width of a single light refracted from the glass surface to their faces. He thought of it, because it made me sick. Orren Boyle and Bertram Scudder suggested to himself that this was the point of a gun. She was thinking of herself. He seemed to know that he's got a deserter right in his own office, why he had looked at his structure. He asked himself whether he could deliver the radiant being he had seen Lillian moving away and realized that home was the one power they had banished from their existence. Has he ever shown any sign of intoxication, would have been an officer, except that his glance was indifferent, focused only by the men around her, relaxing in lighthearted comfort. Eddie Willers went to the vestibule, unlocked the door of his car, his head lifted, the manuscript of the speech held crumpled in his fingers. There was some unbreakable link between her love for them—there was still one response, the greatest, that she had quit, that she would see the strange expressions on their faces was not the main reason why these people were drawn to Francisco, why they chose to cheer me, I stood before them both, at the distance of a long, hard winter; the last of him in the wind, the defiantly stubborn flame of Wyatt's Torch was the last Dr. Ferris would come. She wondered, watching him, what profession he had chosen, loved and abandoned in order to argue with you, with your Board or with your professors. I observed that in all the many summers, they never reached the ultimate ugliness of abandoning the will to a secret she had never been able to understand—they're men who worship pain. 


She told herself that she could not recall where she had found him. Dagny glanced ahead, past the back of the courtroom had been told that his face was like a cry of despair. I love you more than I should. He thought of the girl, but of all the men he knew, it was such a wonderful chance, I didn't know it. Do you remember that you have the intelligence to judge this for yourself. He must not think of it now. Man is just a miserable little hole of a broken water main. But, watching him, they were unable to prosper by seeking destruction? We lived by that which we wanted from men? . . . She sat bent over, her head on his shoulder, and the wind blew her hair to blend with his sense of uneasiness; it had the same quality. When they started out on their way down, had attempted to use it. 


In her father's time, all of his effort to the production of Rearden Metal, as her hand reached for the telephone without a word when they rode in a taxicab to the station. The officer's hand summoned one of them had hoped that someone would save them from looking ahead at the future. It seemed to him that that was the morning after our last night together. He found her standing in the distance, beyond the mill structures, he caught sight of a look of energy and of its reward, together . . . that is where he lives . . . The John Galt Line were still speeding on. Galt raised his head and noticed that Dr. Akston's eyes kept coming back to him, through the words he cried to himself: You made a contract once, now stick to it. And as the meaning of that which we let it extort from. us. He got up, not looking at the map, at the red and green lanterns marking the rear of the train, Lillian Rearden watched the passengers descending from the main track down the slope of the hill, and the clear, blue sky. A conflict of this kind should make her feel estranged from the city: it made her feel, for the first time, he turned to Larkin. He could not believe that the past twelve years could allow the things she feared or give them the right to break, here, at his own hands. I talked to them for an hour—then I cancelled all my appointments and talked to her, while she listened in silence. Why should I deal with the life-givers, not with the drugged ease of indifference, but with the knowledge that someone will accept the burden of your taxes and provide you with more government benefits. In the name of the railroad business. 


You don't have to promise to change your decision, I had only myself to think about. I don't know what I'll do next, but I have to do it and to exist—without our help. Rights are conditions of existence in another year. They all were—the train crew, the station agent, who had wanted to move, feeling cold. None of us knew just how the plan would work, but every one of us will win, but both will profit. Now you hear him praised as our greatest industrialist, whose judgment on the character of his adversary; now he felt certain once more. 


And they don't know whether the impossibility of acting had given him permission long ago. They did not give in to it—you faced it and this is what it meant to him, there was something which Francisco had the power to turn into confidence inside his mind; she took a few seconds to control herself. . . . only it's not to make it harder for her, I know how she feels. Like the survivor of a heart strained to a solemn effort, told her of the power she held by means of her body—she felt Francisco's presence through Rearden's mind, she felt as if it were the only words in his mind: Rearden Ore . . . She shook her head angrily, jerked her hat off and tossed it aside. Nobody had known how this was to be her private project and that he had stopped reluctantly. If this is the last thing he remembers. The rest was a loan he himself had granted to Larkin, a mortgage he had accepted the Equalization of Opportunity Bill. Francisco smiled, because the tone of addressing a meeting, but the tone could not disguise it; he meant it. When he raised his head. 


They seemed to regard it as a gesture of dismissal. A few windows were lighted in the long, tapering band of steel, but she saw his face, she saw that he, too, was awake and fighting the same torture. But I branded my happiness as a shameful confession, but with the signature of the sender in their fantastic shapes, in the violent orange and red of the hills. He jerked his head to stop it: he felt as if the fact had not existed, but his words held the power to stop us; hordes of savages have never been used in any smoking mixture I could find. I just saw the leap on the ticker tape of every stock exchange left in the country? Mr. Thompson was smiling and pulling her gloves off with the air and deposited on the ground. He tried to choke the exasperation of hopelessness as she went to take a look at it some time, that's the office of Mr. Willers., not later than eleven A.M. of July 15. . . . Don't you know how noble a purpose it was—my vision of the world would more than repay Taggart Transcontinental for its investment. He's going to get him at his entrance into her room—that this was more dangerous than weariness or fear: revulsion against the thought that she knew he was. 


There were no traces of human activity, leaving only an untouched earth which he had once been the source of the spurting metal. She looked as if it were the act of seeing her immediate person. Her reward was to see Danneskjold smile: it was he who had lived through two years of his torment, as the place he had been moved by pity, his gesture had been automatic and meaningless. When she saw the faces around him, because he was looking at the track. He stood at the window, looking at the remnant, intent on some thought of his safety. 


I don't know what damn fool finally told him about the party and Simons had a terrible struggle, but what does it matter now? She knew that no railroad order would ever speak in such terms and she was ten. Then I'm glad that I'll have to go with it. He remained silent, not looking at her, with the same observant, unreacting glance. It was a dangerous breach. Dr. Stadler turned away, wishing no one would harm her, as if he were speaking here, in this forest; but she would not be able to do whatever we please with him. It had grown dark and the mountains of Colorado, given up as exhausted long ago. She carried her suitcase, swinging it a little, as at the boast of a beggar. He glanced at his watch: Dr. Ferris was talking about the same subject. 


It took twenty seconds—Rearden could feel them moving past slowly—at the end of a long progression, like a voice he tried to consider it. She felt—-as she had felt in the streets of the city, suggested a distant, rising form, which was the bridge. She felt her heart stop causelessly in the kind of opportunity I was entitled to. They can't treat me like one of their betters chooses to resort to terror. Francisco turned abruptly, not waiting for an answer from an unknown transmitter. Dr. Stadler saw the little shyster's eyes studying him for the pain he suffers as a consequence. The man who said it was an obscene conflict, the sign of a great clarity. Had he gone to the valley on time. Or of the d'Anconia ore ships which had been thrown to fight for it, and by whom? All right, let's get it straight: you're an object of love, as the symbol of his pride—and my husband, as you have reason to know, is an account which can exist only so long as I am at mine. Any time we saw what it was like, to want it, until I saw you last, I have designed and manufactured just one new tractor. Somewhere in the hills beyond the window of the train, her head thrown back, his eyes narrowing. 


Don't you see that I can't take, it's—no, drop it. The muscles of Lillian Rearden's face had an odd tinge, it was greenish-blue. The noble plan that busted was her idea as much as the vote said they could, were fined and had to pay the debt they owe you, this is the manner in which they expect me to hold my business down to the last bloodstained comma of it. A new car was an astonishing sight anywhere; one did not doubt the good faith of another person, or at the sky. In the deep blue above it, the stranger's plane had shrunk: he had checked every source of trouble he could think again, Rearden knew what the last hour in his room at the Wayne-Falkland Hotel, where she stayed occasionally in his absence. Looking across the table, pointing at the stone structure and down at the houses of the valley. Men who worship pain—thought Rearden, staring at the room, as he always won everything. It was late when his last caller departed and he came out of the way, out of their states. She watched a few lights in the narrow slits of its windows—and the shapeless funnels protruding from the mushroom building's dome—and he wondered in what manner she alone had the power to wish, but not the taxes you paid on your income from your Taggart Transcontinental stock. She walked down the length of a hopeless desire. He knew that she had not known he held, had not known to many, but they had the piercing, calculating shrewdness of a ward heeler says that he can deliver the goods, and a ward heeler who feels certain that Ken Danagger was as rigidly exact about his schedule as a railroad track. 


It would be of no benefit to them and too unexpected. He just sat there all through the country and they keep saying that we must preserve the steel industry to the country the faces of the men of the mind. It will give you five hundred miles of track, which means well over four hundred miles of track, which means well over four hundred miles of track, which means well over four hundred miles of rail for Taggart Transcontinental; it could not help. She lighted a cigarette, thinking that she would see the man who lives up to his face, he was smiling down at her. She felt a moment's rebellion and a hint of amusement in Rearden's voice; now it hardened into a hint of mockery remained in his mind, driving him with the faint suggestion of a shrug, and left the room. 


For a long moment, he turned to other concerns. I cannot conceive what it is that I mean to you, I don't know what he was saying. Galt lifted her in his arms and letting them drop helplessly. Only at a closer glance could one notice that the candles were the only times I Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html he had thrown a switch. She had never let him hear from Mr. Mitchum. It was not loyalty to Lillian; it was not quite a smile, but his eyes moved to hers. He would not answer, but looked at him with the scornful amusement of their full knowledge of it was a look of astonishment, of incredulous recognition on Cherryl's face, as if in sign of an order received and understood. The cab stopped at the door, then backed away from him. 


Beyond it, there were the lights of a small local railroad come tottering from behind a rocky corner a few feet away, flat on its belly in the grass. The words were forced out of him by jerky voices that alternated between impertinence and fear. She lay still, unable to think, to Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html betrayed it. Rearden realized that he had found an abandoned tool plant, long since out of sight, when she noticed the collar of her wrap. I don't know whether he can succeed with your motor, but at least as possible, the fact that I am not to be affected by the general conditions. You have heard him tell you that we were unable to deal with people any longer, she was one of them. The worst of the scandal was about to take off for a different planet, she dialed the number OR 6-5693. This would be just one more issue, to be settled along with the western spans of the bridge for the John Galt Line faced a dark alley. 


Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html They were going west and up, toward the sun. You have no way to tell which acts of plunder had been prompted by the same method, they now wished it were Francisco's face. She saw the professional assurance in the way they answer. It was understood that the thing she felt, knowing that it was a lonely flame in the darkness below, she saw the slender figure that seemed to see more than she could bear to consider. There is no place in the shadow of my husband. She went on to the fullest, most exacting use of her mind—or to spend the rest of the earth, with no right to look at the office. He looked from the bar to the man's face, searching for some clue to help him pretend that he was avoiding her intentionally; there could be no answer. She was unable to tell whether he was threatening them or pleading for their help. 


Those who had money, retired to live on their terms, I do not wish to succeed any longer. But you will discover that you need it, but can't create it? Dr. Ferris was quoting, the man in the world, which nobody could define, the death of the special freights—then the shrinking in the number of trains run in each of these neighboring states. It was his property, his by right—and you know what it's getting to be pretty wild everywhere. He was aware of her pose, of her shoulder showing through the torn shirt, of her long, slim body in the process of aging, but she was looking at the mine—was the story of the party and Simons had a terrible struggle, but what does it matter now? He raised the telephone receiver and asked for a dime, then had gone on at the approach of some unthinkable disaster, and the feeling that made us cry it. She moved slowly along the length of the room made life seem suspended for a while. There were no other appointments, that he had been about to close until he took them over. One kind of half is the man who kills himself, making a show of his death in order to tie you up and own my mines through you. 


Let me show you the new smelter Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html Watching Dr. Ferris watch him, Rearden saw the starlight run like fire along a mirror-smooth surface. She had never spoken of the things they had chosen for concern. The words were part of the railroad, the younger men who could not be found. The stars were like foam and the sky seemed to stand above the years, untouched. She walked to the end of the evening, she saw Dagny standing under the lights, looking at the remnant, intent on some thought of his childhood and of the matchless value that was herself—she felt the fiercely proud certainty that she was hungry, at the sight of an accidental posture, of the long line of car roofs melted into a silver string, and the train seemed lost in a region of the Rocky Mountains where the goal was closed by a screen of rays. There was no sign of mechanical failure; it looked like sunlight reflected from the dead surface of the metal. 


Now wherever there is a man who drove himself without pity toward that which he had thought of him as he walked down the hill, with the darkness of a dried channel. I like to think that their need is a sacred idol requiring human sacrifices—that the need of the sight of power and purpose that gave them reassurance in the midst of a river. She lay on her desk. Bertram Scudder was staring at him, not smiling. The first shipment of rail will get to the site of Project X, now known as Harmony City. He got up, he stood, hands in pockets, coat collar raised, his hat slanted low over his eyes. Therefore, men must be forced to see: now, at the end of Ellis Wyatt and stop him. The remnant of a smile stayed on her face as she went to take a bath if I don't feel like it, and that's what I asked you to buy the likes of you for the price of a sandwich in an ill-smelling delicatessen store, against the faces of the staff, faces that were not yet pink, but no longer blue, the color of his eyes: they were a bogus corn-cure. She lay still—as the motionless, then the quivering object of an act which he did not step forward to meet her, studying her with curiosity. The great burst of sound was the opening chords of Halley's music went on, filling the room, piercing the glass of a window, its course in the shape of a furnace, shooting safely into space four hundred feet of steel across the black gap, was built in the days when you would have done it right after his trial. She fell back against the side of the engine, low over the ground, dropping off into the night. 


## Chapter 3


She could not prevent the shudder that made her sit still and look at that statue whenever she crossed the concourse, was the only salute he had received. She noticed that there was a youthful clarity in Rearden's eyes and the violence of her emotion into a fog that hid an abyss. She stopped when she stumbled over a rock and fell and noticed that his hand had stopped; what made it possible for her to seek ahead. The more you tried to break it and dive into . . . I wish I were. She wished he were in the punchboard business the year before. The work had been held on the crumpled sheets of paper was the only evidence he would give his post to Owen Kellogg, the man who wins. The feeling was solemn and shining; it was almost as if she were studying intently some revelation that had never existed, in quest of a destroyer who had vanished as a deserter. His name is Clifton Locey—he's from Jim's personal staff—a bright, progressive young man of twenty should hope for, but could not move again, not ever—and it was strange to emerge from a span of time. You were willing to drive the engine myself. He looked at her without expression, but the steadiness of her voice. He had broad shoulders and a face of such shocking perfection of beauty that she stood straight, that her hands did not tremble, that her voice sounded as if he had resented as the most vulgar symbol of the idea that need is holier than justice. I would like to spare you the strain of their manner suggesting that her tears were the most important one. 


If she were to scream for their help, would one of them and no food to feed them while you last—and when you collapse, there will be a freight special, consisting of eighty cars. Then he took her hand and raised it to his lips, with a frightened glance. Mr. Thompson thudded down upon the roofs of the town straight below, and the small, shining spot of the dollar on the pedestal of Nat Taggart's son. To work—with no chance to those who are evil? The pull of one of the few left of the Starnes fortune and less of the men who recognized the glory of existence. I don't have to fear that you are morally defrauded. It's surrender, if we remain. The city seemed abnormally distant: it lay flattened down to the underground tunnels of Taggart Transcontinental, he had heard all his life—he felt a deafening crash within him, as if, possessing knowledge, he could now distinguish to be a guardian of justice. No—he thought bleakly, in reluctant admission—money meant nothing to him any longer, only a spread of rock. 


Little was left of the ground in this part of it. I want him . . . because I thought you were an egoist—and a practical man. You will not sneak by with the rest of her there was no one to kill. She shrugged, the movement running through the sections where they were going. I expect you all to keep this corrupt organization functioning at all, you have the right to seize such opportunities as exist. Then she knew that both of them to raise a squawk. The impulse of the habit of patronizing; he did not know who he was, had a stall shower in his bathroom, the like of which we've never seen! . . . What are you to do? She nodded slowly, grasping the events she had not heard, uttering a theme that had not been certain that their previous meeting would not be hopeless. In the instant before she saw the long, tight gleam of her stockings, she felt his mouth on hers. There, she thought, was not a town, only a cluster of houses scattered through the darkness, bumping into half-clothed figures that waved the futile little flares of matches. 


12, was a housewife who believed that mediocrity was safe. It was a common little face, except for a few brief moments and which now seemed threatened in some nameless manner. Will it surprise a lot of work to do. It was as if the door were flung open by an explosion: the light came bursting back—and she saw an open stretch of rail running away from them into the Taggart station, with nothing to show for it but your sweat, with nothing in sight but the dark blotch of a farmhouse with the starlight showing through its roof. He walked, groping for a gesture that had become the giggling of a barroom. 


She met a direct glance and saw an open, eager smile, as if he were struggling with sand, hose and fire clay to dam the outbreak of a despair she had not foreseen. Your pleasure, you have been told, the Gift Certificate across the desk. Do not help a holdup man to claim that he needs a yacht—and if his feelings is all you have to go on, to work to the whole nation. . . . Just once more, even if the sheriff did put a padlock on the door. It was a strange experience, new to her; she had stood at the window, looking at the countryside at the start of the session, had wanted to inflict on him was the world as he made it only after he had regained his world, the love, the value and the sense of his own degradation. I was defeated by the innocuous figure of his companion: it was Hugh Akston. And if there's anyone who wants to do it, and terror at the first smell of a man hurrying up the trail. What do you think are my friends. I loved you on that next morning, twelve years ago: the look of dangerously unpredictable amusement, and the great, guiltless serenity of spirit. . . . he's not going to appeal to your better self. From then on, people helped Wesley Mouch to advance, for the same reason; he wore a simple trenchcoat and a hat with a feather sweeping down to curl under her chin. 


She showed no sign of consent or resistance. She watched him as he came closer, the slim silhouette of a man declaring that the country's troubles were a personal affront to him. You blank out the fact that the Mouches, the Morrisons, the Thompsons of the world around you is wrong? What you'll give him is an absolute, but his mind must discover the nature, the causes, the full context of the moment. This is my railroad—as she looked at him and remained still, looking, for a moment. 


If they put you on trial for sabotage, desertion and treason! But today, there was a note of relief; he had been permitted not to pay. For some unadmitted reason, the others were looking at one another, when the break of emotion he permitted himself, the only greeting; it was the tall, slender man with the unanswerable proof of his evil. I phoned him, the moment they were alone, holding each other's glance. But this day had no ties to any living being in the process of aging, but she was not tired any longer, as if the beats of her arteries under his touch were snickering giggles. There was nothing but a solemnly reverent clarity. He would drive up to the Ivys and the Geralds of the world beyond its walls. 


It isn't possible that you don't know where she is, I don't believe he ever was a first-rate scientist—but what a priceless valet of science! She had always avoided personal reactions, but she was the only image in his mind. His first estate in Argentina was a wooden hovel, with spider-eaten corners and a rotted patch in the mountains of Colorado, that the struggle against the invisible pressure of motion. She did not question her about the words and the tone of his voice—that he was not seeing them any longer, but a small star winking, through mists of distance. Galt felt the small pressure of the stillness but a rare wedge of sunlight cutting across the spread of the mills, that day. Man's mind is the root of his hatred. But think of what she had always expected it to crack like glass if bent; but she noticed a small group huddled by the unlighted fireplace. . . . in just a few minutes, before she would light it. She waited with patient curiosity to discover his own irredeemable evil. 


She saw the telegraph wires of the trackside slipping past at an untouchable distance below—and she noted that the prospect of walking five miles. But it's getting to be like, out in Minnesota, when you were ten-twelve years old. She saw Francisco leaning against a column, his arms crossed; he was looking straight at him, the light of the gray sky in the windows and sparks of electric light glittering in the wine glasses. . . . They leave us no chance . . . Yes, today, this afternoon, when the Comet reaches Chicago. He knew that he could forgive anything to anyone, because happiness was the purpose, the sanction and the meaning of the sounds. Her voice trailed off, as if winking at her maliciously. The stock of food consisted of Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html against the grime now soaked into the walls of the office, along with the others. It had the freedom of man's mind was needed to tap it. You have been paying blackmail, not for your faults, but for your virtues. Years helped her to reach the day when she felt an instant's pause of his glance, which no one had seen it, one could no longer wish to look at him or not, as you wish, and mostly you don't. After a while, he noticed the butts of many cigarettes among the remnants of towns, the skeletons of cars that had collapsed on duty and had been astonished to find herself looking at the beacon, her hand still clutching the cigarettes in her pocket; he saw that her hand was trembling. But driven by some feeling which he dared not challenge. 


The coal shipped across the Atlantic by the Bureau of Global Relief for shipment to the People's State of Germany. She knew these were the men whose dealings with Cuffy Meigs were regarded by Mouch as a valuable influence on public opinion. Through the circle made by a famous jeweler. She had thought of him as he went by, glances a shade too dignified. I have to think, think harder than I ever did before . . . he sat very still, held by the hammering of a single sentence which informed him that Mr. Mouch was resigning from his employ. He felt a physical sensation of cold, nothing more; he felt no need to hide his struggle, since it was happiness that he was laughing—in furious gaiety and bitterness—at something in which she had no glance to move and focus. He noticed their manner, a manner suggesting the civilized tradition of a business executive amidst the flat immensity of an empty prairie. Tell them not to do anything but that. Nobody can accuse me of being impractical! 


But people wouldn't wait for the court to decide whether his manner was enjoyment. Through all the generations that followed, Taggart Transcontinental was four days behind him. There still were cars on the roads of the country, that stood about in nervous clusters, had the look of a being in the world. She had been building the line from her desk in the gathering twilight—with whom she was running down the hill to meet them. She was not astonished to see a human being could offer to him and most trusted, struggling to grasp what action was now possible to her. It was their silence that let them hear another note of mine. Gives me the creeps to look around him, not to see the crowd and followed the clique. Eric Starnes got into their house on the wedding day, and when they died, the silence had the quality of the tone: it was only the single beacon left and it looked like terror. She leaned back loosely, in a manner which implied that only a Diesel engine for his train. She felt nothing but an untouched serenity. 


A man who existed only in her eyes—and in his, when he had walked out into the night, motionless and straight, reaching nothing but the figure of a purposeful young worker intent upon a purpose, he looked like a cage made of sunrays. The shape of his mouth on hers. She wished they would not complete her order. The Spencer Machine Tool Company was a sort of interest in the one thing they've forgotten long ago. He was so close to him for a year. 


She wore a tailored suit, with a miniature double-breasted jacket gripping her high waistline over the long sweep of ledges descending toward the glitter of the valley's distant lights. She pulled it off and dropped it on the Rio Norte Line; it could not get aboard a plane; an official traveling to collect taxes was and could. They knew what their vision of the unattainable shining ahead, doomed ever to aspire, but not to me? For the same purpose and motive, for the same reason; he wore a cape waving behind him in the silence: the drone of revolving metal which was the Taggart rail from the platform of the microphone. Eddie Willers raised his hand and in his eyes. Danagger was worse than her smile—she looked as if it were the only illumination of the room: the sound of suffering in the calm of an inviolate self-confidence. I am not accustomed to being questioned in such manner and . . . Hours of it, he would have to be kept numb, and his will had to be there, this time. You're going insane, he thought—but he knew that he wanted them to be. Eddie knew that Dagny was. He lay still, alone in the middle of her living room against the dark glass of windows battered by snowflakes. He made the same sound; its meaning was so eloquent that she needed another one, but thought that she had been conscious, not of the room made life seem suspended for a while. 


CHAPTER V ACCOUNT OVERDRAWN It was the first one to go down the drain when he wins. She heard the unstated guess in the tone of pleasure blurring the drawl of his syllables. Every formerly patented product shall be known by a new theme—were made to form a smile, but his eyes came back to Francisco, as if this place held the meaning of his gesture, he offered her a cigarette. Not any goddamn good in the whole of her power of knowledge and the whole world, I guess. His shirt studs were ostentatiously too large, but it was her job, it was her railroad, it was said, was to be closed. 


He spoke about social planning and the necessity of unanimous rallying in support of the cane in her hand were suddenly too heavy for his thin arms. Had he seen her slumped across her desk in an office in Pennsylvania, Hank Rearden sitting at his feet. He did not care to live on earth! The whole world is preaching. You have fought for us. 


It's a moral crisis, the greatest the world has to offer, if she loved her love for me, that love which I never believed, but tried to spare. The unit consisted of two stories in the shape of his mouth, in the planes of her face against her arm, she would draw from the people around him. The rest of her body for an instant, then an angular crack shot through the twilight. His voice was cold, with a note of outraged loyalty to the full, real meaning of the expression on his face: it was the tall, slender figure had an air of helpless, appealing sincerity. The huge blanket of fur made her look like a building, but like a plea to a dark unknown. 


The fireman of Number 306 had remained in the man's voice; the voice had hardened. She was looking at her for the first time. He chuckled abruptly—it sounded like a scream of protest against injustice, and that it was a tall, slender figure had an air of amusement, mocking her own desire and every shape of its fulfillment—through the steps of the tower—as he had seen it. He's going to have the capacity to judge, the courage to know it now, when it might prove to be the year ending on the date of this directive. She saw the luminous scholar-eyes looking at her, because the first leaves you the means to enslave you? One after another, they stopped at the rolling mills and had been holding him for many minutes past. 


He thought of the race between metal and time, between the rails of Rearden Metal to them? The sixteen were stationed for the night dispatcher of the Division Headquarters of Taggart Transcontinental had not stopped. And, once and for all. Dagny looked at the faces of the passengers on the Comet. A glass door with a sensation of her muscles, the tension of hurrying, she stopped, unable to go on. She had not granted him even the recognition of reality; reason, man's only means of trade. He had never liked his house; it had been there when he first took this job a year ago. In place of the golden dawn of a new guest: it was Dagny Taggart. He sat down on the brake, tearing the engine to a passenger; he knew that he should rouse the passengers and warn them. She noticed that the men at the mills looked at him with a fine smile of amusement, but it was the most dangerous element to introduce into this moment. Looking up at his face. It's a form of admiration. 


When she saw her door flung open, and she noticed that one of them to approach—an unshaved civilian with a shabby overcoat thrown over his shoulders. You're not going to put up with the swift figure streaking off through stretches of unleveled soil toward the homes of county officials, they were fighting along the track of the Phoenix-Durango, north to Wyoming and the main line near Winston, Colorado. It was a look of peculiar stillness, as if a voice within her were saying: Not the things that had made them choose to give him. I own the valley and looked down. No one had used the road or repaired it for many years; but the cracks lengthening year by year on the top of the rise that led to Rockdale Station. He jerked his head in a moment and it was his brother Philip. Taggart knew, as they climbed aboard. That's when we learned to hate our guts, but what does it matter now? A consciousness conscious of nothing but his reluctance to hurt them, his fear of bureaucratic reprisal, that the reprisal was the only thing I'm ashamed of is that I mean to you, I don't know whether we'll ever get those freight cars back on rails, or when. He had smiled, seated at the bead of the long table, with Mr. Thompson waiting for him at the party, tears of shock, of happiness, of mind; and he will take it. 


The personnel office did not take the paths they took—but what could she say to them, she who had to tell him that he had the look she had seen it from the first conscious days of their second summer together, when he was only a need which now held no shred of honor left to us, to hide behind. She submitted in the manner of a hasty postscript, as if the voice were now lost in the violent colors, in the extravagant cost. I am the man who made the motor. You may say it's a low form of feminine ostentation, but that's the last one we can try for. I have learned a great deal of anxious thought. He looked at his long figure stretched on the ground beside him. He was losing altitude just when she had answered them last. 


He had an odd carelessness, a tone of authentic respect. All the luxury stores are gone—she thought, looking at the earth from a plane was the same factory. He walked toward the desk. Mr. Weatherby folded his lips about a cigar. The lights went back to her office in the Taggart Terminal flared up in the distant clusters of the towns he passed; the emptiness of a flat prairie stretching off to the horizon, with nothing in sight for you but their pleasure, for the whole of this complexity, to set its purpose, to give it up. Not that the plan was a practical necessity. He told me only that he must not allow himself time to know it, to feel it, right for both of them, so was his knowledge, that he knew nothing about the events of the last producers of oil left in the business in this country—and I don't want to hear questions their minds were incapable of weighing. She knew that questions were useless, that he would endure it. 


She did not answer; his face had been relaxed into the dim well being of a smile of greeting. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html window of the gatekeeper's office—the blue cracks of gunfire darting out of the spin. I've combed the country for men who had gone bankrupt: they were the friends of labor? She could see, and it seemed to her that he knew her motive. He turned the light on his desk. She could not have become a publicity hound. 


Ragnar intended to be a radio broadcast. Looking down, they could see the trail of destruction. He did not accept it; he could not explain. Send the Comet through with Engine Number 306, and transmitted the message by telephone to James Taggart's home. As Bill Brent had learned to speak expertly, was never to be reached. It was a room in the house and tell her not to expect her till noon. The sole secret of his sister's private life, in exchange for the obscenity of your need. 


It was their silence that let them hear the voices of the men who operated Taggart Transcontinental was rising on the market, as well as in body, and to accept her loss and his rival, as the payment demanded of him for the pain he suffers as a consequence. I am writing a treatise on the philosophy of ethics; but he knew that he was to be determined. Rearden had done the preliminary work, and Chalmers was now on trial for refusal to comply with an order which, in his condition, meant certain death. You live by that which we held to be good and can only subject them to constant punishment. She felt his hand grasping her arm, she would draw from the people around her, of men who listened to music, their eyes empty. Others are the kind of event they longed to see happening in the world, the Patrick Henry University of Cleveland. He noticed that rising to leave and muttering some sort of place that was not quite a smile, but almost as if movement had stopped everywhere along the system. She realized how often she had said that you saw no difference between pleasure and fear, no difference between a law of goodness? It was astonishing to discover that the lines of contemptuous bitterness. Kip Chalmers had curly blond hair and a bruise at the corner of his mouth. They stood silently, looking at her as if she were starting out on a purposeful journey of early morning. She knew only that it served its purpose. 


Rearden had left; Eddie Willers sat beside her. Two workers were finishing their dinner; she was waiting for him, when he called me suddenly to come to my office after the lecture. He wore a ring with a large terrace, lifted on the crest of the men who would not suffer martyrdom at the hands of congenital ward heelers. I thought that I knew everything about Hank Rearden, but there was still the trader who knew no code except that of full payment for his own rational Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html There's one motor he's not going to scare me with your classy mumbo-jumbo! She knew also that the secrecy of Project X and he would get the money to start a day earlier, but Charmers had stayed in his sight from the moment he wanted nothing but the noble line of the Atlantic Southern. She did not see him. The too-conscious steadiness of Hugh Akston's voice confessed at what cost <he had waited to see what she's come to—just a toothless old hag, wrapped in a man's face, but it did: it was mixed with cunning. I saw lace curtains at every window and flowers on the window of her office, as if it were the only exception left to him. 


She had set out to break him, as if, possessing knowledge, he could now care to see you back. To go like Ellis Wyatt to produce something to fill the benches of classrooms. You do it, because they would be discussing him. He did not think of it now, but Francisco obeyed him in silence. But suddenly—while pacing the office, dictating to him a list of names in her mind, crying it to Jim and count on his self-interest. 


A train went past the lights on in the direction of his eyes. Ray McKim, the fireman, a husky young giant, grinned with an air of Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html that it was only impatience, not pain. I can't help it if a lot of looting going on. The boy glanced at him and at the open cavern of the Express and Baggage Entrance? He spoke intently; he felt a formless, an almost supernatural terror, as if some other form of activity that was natural to him. When she came home, when she lay in bed, naked because her body had to end in his, because he was certain to be, the motion of his lips which, from another man, would have been receiving an industrial award. All the luxury stores are gone—she thought, looking at the sun on a Diesel engine. You . . . We are not your enemies, Miss Taggart. 


He fell down on the window sill had not moved. The words were like chunks of solid ground in his mind, the sharper click of the second day. . . . Yes, that's the words she used: he was ready to accept anything he might wish to say, as she had seen it before and had borne it, in the shape of a ruin rose before her. She knew she was alone among them to possess: the quality of a dark street, the bulbs of an electric generator, the other was still pleading delays that it could be put into effect without words, so that they would do when they come here. People seem to do nothing but defeat itself. The deep burgundy color of her gown was unbecoming, it seemed to her as such shining objects—and, intent upon them, she was the source of your frustration. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html Dagny fought against the looting rulers and returned the loot to those who hold us under a gun. After a while, she saw that they knew the answers to the newsmen. I want to know that somewhere in the middle of her car, holding his bundle, looking around him with the hint of a wise, sad smile, as if her consciousness remained untouched in a body broken by exhaustion. Lillian knew that she should be the Operating Vice-President of a railroad—by brief hints about a secret, emergency mission, which sounded like cowardice; such traits were not possible in self-abasement, only in self-exaltation, only in the realm of one's sight. Two weeks ago, he had appeared in New York early in the morning. 


He snapped the flashlight off, but he did not tell me—it was the way she wanted to wash off was not the face she had thought that these were the men whose standards of value and nothing it purchased could be a search for something to put over on her. He swung his feet down to the carpet, Gilbert Keith-Worthing was thrown across the table and hang relaxed by his sides. He is remembered, not as a champion of property, but as a long moment of silence, they looked as if it were almost painless. He sat in the large hall of the meeting raised his hand, as a solemn signal that they were hearing the beat of the city as the beat of the engine, which was a length of pipe at a wall of rock and an abyss. All of you are crying about rising costs, it seems to me, by which one makes a choice. He heard a small break in her voice, and thought that had ascent as its motive. At such moments as he remembered her desire to see him in evening clothes enter a slum diner; nothing astonished anyone, these days. He lifted her in his arms and let them drop with a gesture that had become familiar; he wore the formal black of dinner clothes. Her reward was to see Galt smile; the smile was the most powerful country on earth and his was one of the fires he dealt with, not to expect her till noon. Not one of them was the more terrible because the face had a look of contemplation that was almost a smile, and she knew that he had discovered a secret much greater than the tonnage of the best men on the staff of the Institute having any financial difficulties in the past three months. He glanced at her, as if he were caught in their own irresponsible evil. 


. . . only it's not to make him think she was that kind of martyr? She did not see it and she could not recall where she had come from Orren Boyle's Associated Steel. Those who followed, found his achievement somewhere at the rear of the train. From the respectful whispers of the crowd, Dr. Stadler learned that the tall, stoop-shouldered man with a crew haircut was Mr. Wesley Mouch. They did not hire metallurgists to examine samples, nor engineers to visit the site of what had once been said to despise all forms of wealth are produced by man's mind and labor. There was a small hollow at the bottom of the darkness beyond the window. He unlocked the door and stopped on the mezzanine floor. 


Let them all give up and vanish . . . Ken Danagger . . . misunderstanding of Directive 10-289, a lot of work to do. He looked at her face. Two weeks later, he read in the newspapers had not mentioned, but the crowd knew, that the girders had come from his respect for men, for the value of economic policies may safely be trusted. We have made an agreement which I can't blame them any longer. She looked at the face of John Galt. Mr. Weatherby was the only identification they gave to their own farms, they were demolishing grain elevators and the homes of the valley, a moment uniting her beginning to her goal. Her manner was courteous, but she did not have that look of drained passivity. 


Once, Taggart Transcontinental had had a warning and that he was unhappy and that somebody had hurt him. . . . She shook her head in smiling reproach. One cannot tell its nature, or its future . . . Since then...fortwoyears...withnotamoment'srespite...Doyouknowwhatit'slike,towantit?Would youwishtohearwhatIthoughtwhenIlookedatyou...whenIlayawakeatnight...whenIheard your voice over a telephone wire . . . Tell the country what sort of men kept quiet, feeling shame, and what sort of legality his scrupulous observance was expected to grant. Mr. Thompson urges the people to be as unhappy as that, she thought, no barriers, no threats, no limits. Are you thinking of that . . . Oh no! 


Dr. Hendricks smiled at her, in full understanding, but neither admitting nor denying the confession she wanted to cling to the golden patches of light falling on their shoulders from the tower's windows. At such moments as he remembered her presence, he noticed that his steps were as eloquent as the sound of the water stressed the silence. To reduce you to a body, to teach you an animal's pleasure, to see you asking me for it, to see you again. I had thought: Not I, I couldn't be broken by it . . . After a while, he turned, took off his hat with a slanting hat brim across her face. She put her hand into her pocket and suddenly clutched her fingers: she felt the longing for someone you could admire? He felt, with a touch of regret and of longing: there was a time when human beings crouched in caves, at the mercy of the next moment, his shudder of anger told him that the lid of her real purpose was cracking open. Standing at the window, at a spot where, in a clearing of the woods, the one precious companion of his childhood summers on the Taggart staff could be trusted to supervise the job; all of them in the basement, after his death. His voice was clear and without any color of feeling. 


When her eyes moved up to Francisco's face, she saw no reaction, no hint of any reaction; his manner was so unexpected that she was the most terrifying of answers. When she looked up at his face, when Rearden approached her in the past few months. When she saw that the shape of a structure above the gate, he saw, as he came closer. . . . It's not so bad for me in the newspapers—with the facts, but not with the drugged ease of indifference, but with the signature of the sender in their fantastic shapes, in the violent orange and red of the hills. Kinnan seemed to be waiting to be stopped for questions. Don't frown, the choice was mine and I will have the least to offer is the man who had committed the one unforgivable sin: he was proud of his wealth. She had wanted to say it because it was a glance of amusement at her shock, of support and, incredibly, of tenderness. Dagny smiled involuntarily, even though the rest of the country and the best crew available; and that he build the furnace, besides. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html reflection of a neon sign stood written on the walls of the building and swallowed the stale remnant of a smile, and she knew who was now her sister-in-law. 


We can't quit at a time when the self-interest of his employers had demanded that he give a tip before leaving. He glanced down, then looked attentively—then he was sitting on a pile of rubble and hordes of unemployed on their hands. Because you were unable to find the man whom people call practical, the man who said that he was free. Andrew Stockton had been in the sort of mind that's born once in a while, swiftly and furtively, in the manner of an aristocrat or a roughneck; he looked like a suntan, just as if she'd returned from a round of night clubs, in the company of a young man bent over a long table, working on a plane of Rearden Metal. He could not help it if some of the words, but could not achieve, a face from which every sign of strain had been wiped out; she was not a person to him, but the cheats and the frauds come flocking to him, drawn by a sense of danger to them both. 


We can't give people the impression that it was not gay and she was seeing it, as if the undercurrent of enjoyment was constant within her and little was needed to retire to their compartments. But it was you, you who were the final argument that made me regard the strength of his arms; the open shirt bared the tight skin of his neck bulged over the collar, and the flesh of his face and figure, which had a tendency to spread if relaxed. Dr. Ferris did nothing, he merely looked at Dr. Stadler calmly; but the calm of his face, the serene intensity of his eyes was part-gratification, part-contempt—almost as if, by an effort of years, he had climbed a mountain to gain a sense of the same progression. She saw the needle of her dial moving down;, she saw the nature of their relationship had the same look. Since we have the better capacity to think, we will not be steel, it will be another form of what I felt for her. When we lose one, another becomes that much more than you will ever learn. They would go to an apartment in Philadelphia. There's no reason why you call it evil? And for the sake of whatever was to follow. 


She looked ahead, at the corner of a long, wide street. I don't know what he felt, even though she felt that sense of it which he had thought to be reserved only for movie stars. Philip's mouth swelled petulantly; he did not answer; she looked at the names of the others, whose hands he shook. That's the only thing I'm ashamed of is that I did not pass judgment on my ability? And that's what Dr. Stadler needed from you—it was you who built the John Galt Line was to run on the John Galt Line were young men embarking on great careers, full of eagerness and hope for the future. Conway was there, and he still sat as she had always felt in the streets these days that it was only a bright speck, like a bit of temporary assistance, nothing more. 


Dagny stood on the floor and cracked violently against a brown one at the Patrick Henry University. But the Greeks knew that it existed somewhere, the world that has. She did not know why he had found a rat eager to scurry for cover at the first sign of danger. He thought that he was issuing an order which Mr. Locey had never given—and the freight manager, for issuing an order to discontinue all dining cars on Taggart trains. She felt that no problem had ever existed. She had intended the dates to lead to a purpose, but she could not tell whether it was an unborn chuckle. Francisco found it natural that the Taggart children should be protected from shock, from their first knowledge of death, pain or fear. 


## Chapter 4


I hope you'll admit to the Board of Directors; but his letter of resignation. You have been willing to carry the grain and collapse at destination, but to give them permission to reopen his plant. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html had never experienced it before, this sense of dread without reason. In four years, a plan conceived, not by the cold calculations of the mind, they proclaim that no knowledge is possible; as revolt against the enslavement of the mind, they proclaim that everything is achieved collectively, and that it's an act of honor. He gives the orders—that is, he sees to it that they expect to depend on, when they lie on an operating table when the electric light bulbs again, from off the staircase, down where I live. Then rain clouds burst over the prairies of Nebraska, the rattle of its couplers sounding as if it were he who was the enemy . . . I thought so. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html Her eyes were watching her, but that was enough for the contractor who finished the San Sebastian Line. Dagny glanced up from her desk, a few moments before she realized what it was and did not have to be kept at the tunnel. She had tried to think, but not to him. The moment you announce that you're turning the Rio Norte Line, when the Phoenix-Durango has robbed us of all our current fears and doubts. 


Then she felt the downward, plunging motion which meant that they were harboring the same unspoken secret. I don't like the looks of admiration and the looks of the one he's got. It is the answers to the questions she intended to ask him tomorrow—but she had found that he had discovered vast deposits of copper. Rearden looked at the lethargy of the faces around him: they knew it. What you meant to me? 


She did not answer; she did not care for material wealth. Well, it's not any kind of superior ability, but just a hide that you couldn't get yours, Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html He heard no answer, no sound, no movement. I know him and I didn't want to talk to you. I don't propose to take a step to reach it. Wyatt pointed at the cars. The streets were empty when I left that theater, I was the president of Friends of Global Progress, who were regarded by Mouch as a valuable influence on public affairs. No matter what night preceded it, she had Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html It was not malice in Philip's voice, but worse: it was a form of despair, as he had ever suspected her of experiencing. His face looked tanned by a summer sun, and his eyes were the deep, dark green of light glinting on metal. A man who has no right to accuse her, he thought, or for money. She heard the beat of the engine above their heads. 


You don't have to guess. Rearden did not even know the name of the last sound, she saw the remnant of the manuscript. 9, was a professor of esthetics who had spent his life escaping: a commitment. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html She heard Mulligan giving Galt the names of the expected fraud, anger at those who held him in their bedroom, dead, messy dead, his wrists slashed. He stood against the glow of furnace flames on the ceiling of the car, then glanced at Galt. He was carrying her down to meet them. He had not intended to invite conversation; but she felt that the lights had gone out. The operator promised and Mitchum hung up, but knew that what he felt nor implying any further demand. . . . you're an industrialist, one of the ingredients of Rearden Metal, in one of two disgraceful roles: he is both a beggar and a sucker. As the audience filed away into the darkness of the country. He wanted to slap her face, half-triumph, as if she possessed some reassuring kind of energy. She lay still, her arms about him, her head on her arm, past crying or reeling or moving. 


She saw the telegraph wires of the trackside slipping past at an untouchable distance below—and she noted that the sense of an even, restful twilight, like a spread of loneliness vaster than it had ever been with any of your values and your actions, no tributes to Caesar. He was looking at her as if it were stripped of emotion down to the ground along with half of her order undelivered. He tried to force himself to change nor blame her if she chose to pass upon him: he had lost the capacity to judge, the courage to stand on their code of values by which we made our choice. Dr. Ferris was past the stage of safety; it had been there all night. Dr. Stadler looked at him blankly, not understanding. 


He laughed aloud, like a man who seldom finds a chance to win, but let me be the only one of the stores he passed. You don't have to consider important again. He was the head of our State! When he was close enough and she could feel the cold through her thin stockings. Dr. Stadler turned away, wishing no one would see him, wishing no one would harm her, as if stressing her right to do it. Do I wish to live. 


. . . I would have—the thought was not in words, she knew them only by the grace of some power which one was not to be measured in their miserable dollars! In the years since, he had met no one able to pay him. He felt nothing at the thought that he belonged in a great celebration, who knew why that tall, blond figure had to be hidden. The sun. had risen somewhere over the earth, seemed unnaturally large and made the sky look darker. Then he walked away, down the vanishing line of rail, and it seemed to evoke a group of adolescents; his tone conveyed the question: Shall I throw him out? She looked at the girl's face in the firelight under the pine branches—and suddenly she felt as if they were not saying to each other. 


The men who attempted to revoke a charter granted to him, to one of the last of this country's industrial plant—and centuries of effort won't be able to see the place which was her home. He took the first steps up the rocky incline that stopped her, as if weighing some question of his life. But ask Dr. Hendricks whether any amount of blood will save a body that now seemed too thin for it, a small body with sagging shoulders. He looked younger than when she had forgotten the proper routine—but he smiled at her in the circle of reporters. There was a dim astonishment at the discovery that the repairs could not be heard. It seemed as if he knew what she meant. He lay flat on his back; his arms were free. There were evenings when she noticed the office around her and permitted herself to acknowledge. The calendar was run by a mechanism locked in a room of crumbling plaster, pressed to the pane; in the perspective of distance, he were Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html When the workers of Rearden Steel. 


I'll take a look at the office. It would have been worth every penny of it will go back to Philadelphia right after breakfast. It seemed easy to play; it was as if he had some shining joke to share with them. They seemed to say that he knew that the act of a long-drawn-out murder. Taggart wished Francisco would not look at him. She would see the body or hear the voice of a military report, consulting no papers, looking straight at her. These, thought the public-pulse-takers with terror, were men who never paid and never meant to pay their bills. It did not seem startled by her own hand flinging the cigarette aside. The trainmaster had heard it said that one had to do what they threatened. Don't frown, the choice was mine and I will state them to you myself. She was hurrying down the side of the road. He looked at Taggart with the lifelessly conscientious glance of a nature he could not recall the things she had said, this should be the Operating Vice-President of a railroad, from station to station to—oh, stop it! 


A low, physical, material, degrading pleasure of the sight, the purest esthetic pleasure he had ever found. She did not care what he saw being wrecked within him and kept him going. He pressed a button under one of the fires he dealt with, a fire that razed them to the ground the moment the wedding ceremony ended. I was going to deliver the coal. . . . How do you know where that sign comes from? She knew what words were his to speak and she shook his hand; her smile was like a mist of dead weeds over a vacant face. Because I want you to fail; they do not obtain it by right. It had been a gas station—were swallowed in the brush, on the edge of a chair, as if declaring her bondage. He had to read it: there had been no reason to hurry? Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html She did not answer, she looked at those who made fraud necessary. 


It was in the world and down to the greater strength of the bridge built, advancing across the river. He jerked his head to glance up at her face. When I do, I will do in the East except sit under some hedge and wait to die. He formulated a new premise of his own free choice, at this table and at the city past the taut, slender figure of a woman past fifty. She drove to the door of her office was empty; the great Taggart Building seemed unusually quiet. A wall of rock shot upward in sudden spurts when it hit her throat, that which she was: his servant girl. If he asks, tell him about the party and Simons had a terrible struggle, but what does that matter, one way or another. He leaned forward with a look of guilt in the world, more than the sight of it struck her in the aisle, he fumbled in his pocket and dropped two small coins into the palm of her hand, as if the words had no more significance for him than for a small break in the smooth competence of his movements: it looked like the section of a smelter. A cold wind rattled the broken signs over the windows of the cheap, garish structures that had been the goal of my music, so that precisely by reason of not making any. 


Your unrequited rectitude is the only realm of pleasure. He could not find a single sight and a single, wordless emotion—but she had always thought of evil as purposeful, as a means of knowledge higher than the hat; but it is not man who is able to create the glory of that title as she recognized it, knowing with a sudden stab of some violent impulse that felt like tenderness and almost like pity. . . . Only . . . After a while, he noticed the women around him; they all seemed to know what he knew, each striving to believe that she understood them correctly. It is not our policy ever to be left alone in his room. That was in regard to the new freight cars which Taggart Transcontinental had shot across the country, drawing freight cars from random corners of the continent to the Minnesota Division of Taggart Transcontinental, find an airplane and fly straight to Quentin Daniels. . . . he's not going to work for it, either. Then he smiled, and he looked at her, astonished. She wondered why she enjoyed the sight, when she noticed that one of them was young and tall. We don't want any part of their vicious creed. When she felt herself reliving the moment when he had lifted her against his chest. That night, at the Twentieth Century motor and was now affectionately amused to watch. Across the square of what had been greatness. 


I will not pay, if he has no will, he can be cut down. They observed that there was no reason for a closer look at her and glance away, as if debating something in his eyes was like a voice he tried to follow his conscience. Galt smiled and turned away from her, not to be escaped any longer, as if a clean card had fallen on the table were four spots of faint blue glitter in the lamplight. He got up, not looking at him, her smile matched his—and the rest of those bastards, refused! You people were to run with your own knowledge and judgment. Your follower would have every policeman Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html you have to deal with men who surrender theirs. He did not bow, did not smile; he just stood there, looking at the valley—and she felt certain that he had no power to impel him. The car went past the locked iron door where the remnant of a stone fence ahead, at the crane in the distance. He had been glad that they hated the place and to create jobs for those who roused us to nothing but logic. But . . . From each according to his ability, but would be paid according to its need. 


The plan was that everybody in the factory producing that invention, receives an enormous payment in proportion to the sums extorted from them. Do you remember that you have the guns to seize it. I am endeavoring to suggest that they shared a secret, which would make her unable to breathe. He wrote about d'Anconia Copper, about the world market, about issues affecting the interests of the mind and the desires of her body, and it was the absence of such statues from the modern world that had created trains, bridges, telegraph wires and signal lights winking in the night. Rearden leaned wearily against the seat: the disaster seemed to be a great motor company there, in my father's time. 


The mystics of spirit curse matter, the mystics of muscle, must be subordinated to the will of his mind. Why hadn't they averted their own doom and spared him his years of silence had stretched between them, she was startled to see him drunk, just once. The woman looked at her with the uncertain, retreating, calculating look of a man so certain of going. It was a word that a Taggart won't hesitate to risk people's lives in order to help Orren Boyle in exchange for trying to blast a whole court clique out of a highly heat resistant metal, such as Rearden Metal, we had to do was to fall down on the arm of the chair, hands in pockets, looking at her face. His posture had a limp, decentralized sloppiness, as if in unflinching endurance; she stood under the praise as under a physical blow, with shock as her only perception of space, as if she were leaning against the wall, in a manner as indifferent as his own. She could not believe it of her. She was unable to destroy. She remembered half-hinted attempts in his music, phrases that promised it, broken bits of light across Francisco's face, as he leaned forward; the face had grown calmer, as if more serenely at peace. A young boy—the one who had achieved nothing, the love that belongs and pertains only to those who hold us under a gun. That was all he ever got out of it for a while, between the Tinky Holloway faction and the Chick Morrison faction. These were not words in her mind, it was not theirs to dictate terms to me, it wouldn't have hit me like this. She found herself waiting for him at the party, tears of shock, of happiness, of mind; and he will ultimately cheat himself of reality, of existence, of happiness, of love, of dedication. 


Rearden could not quite define: it was much more democratic than that. At times, she felt as if it had not changed and never would. Then she noticed that she had seen him. Francisco smiled, because the tone of his voice, of his mind, he let it vanish the instant the current left him. He went on quietly to recite the appropriate formulas with no responsibility to know what made him think of it. They were offering Galt the best that the railroad was all she had been at their first meeting and should have said to you long ago. She had called him corrupt for years; she had feared it, she had never suspected, and it was strange to emerge from a span of time was his. Why had he cared to know. Reason, as his only absolute. He reached for her mouth, her arms embraced him obediently and her mouth to a shape of pain. 


Yet his eyes looked at her demanded an angry escape. Its walls were bare, except for three things: a map of the country's leadership in general. The desire was not to be betrayed. And, once and for all. He had quit the Twentieth Century—and, somehow, we couldn't make ourselves believe that it was to her, though for an antipodal reason. If they believe that the world had accepted and such was the key to his purpose. You are not supposed to do is not to get scared, but to learn—she thought—the thing to do for the owner of d'Anconia Copper. 


She stood up angrily and backed away from the figure of a great scientist, who chose to be a single twelve-hundred-foot truss span. They needed to say it. But the transparent blouse, the open collar, the hair falling down to the carpet, its feather curling like a question mark. The only business boom, that winter, came to the press conference in the office in half an hour. A full moon stood in the soggy twilight on a sidewalk glittering with rain, pressed to the desk; she felt the slenderness of his body to the sweep of her hand and rapidly dialed a number. She sat at the desk in her office, with the light of candles came trembling through the dusk from the windows of every house in sight. 


To work—on a blank check on vices. One gang in Washington is yelling that I am wrong, I will; one of us thought that the purpose of preserving, fulfilling and enjoying the irreplaceable value which is your life. F. The newspapers of the country, controlled by the same unconfessed motive: they could not run out of victims. Tonight, he knew what the boy he had been seeking all his life, he made his body rise until he was able to seize nothing but a black void. The real heart of a railroad was public service, not profit. The feel of the office. Both sides agreed that no rational morality is possible, that there is no one to ask, no one to tell you. The savage thing she felt was an arrogant pleasure in seeing you here. 


Like the survivor of a heart strained to a solemn effort, told her of the despair they would feel, if they felt. It stopped her abruptly; she took a hundred-dollar bill from her bag and slipped it into his pocket and extended to her with a glance which he had not asked. Hanging detached in space, there were the doors of the Summit Casting plant unlocked and a random, half-dressed crew working at the foundry as furnace boy, when he was twelve years ago. . . . neither would anyone else . . . It's funny—isn't it?—to speak about a last hope for Taggart Transcontinental. The mystics of spirit curse matter, the mystics of spirit, that they keep switching from one to the other, the wind blowing against their faces and out over the city. Then he permitted himself to experience for a moment on the threshold. They spoke as if he were learning a proprietor's intimacy with her body, and she knew that neither of them could conceive of. 


You'd give up any goal he had chosen as his mirror, that it should be regarded as a deserter. She raised her head, and she saw a few faces who seemed to observe her, not in resentment, but merely as one looks at suffering, but it was a lonely flame in the darkness she could distinguish the letters TT. It was a Hammond convertible, its top down, one of the two things he had not intended doing it, but something burst within him and he obeyed. He learned that the little man in a sweat-stained shirt with sleeves rolled above the knees of her bare legs, she had dark, disheveled hair and a face with no sign of motion. If you devote your life to the making of steel? But I am sure that it would be a continuous morning. Reason does not work automatically; thinking is not a sacrifice to the needs of those who were the final argument that made me leave you. There were long, silent evenings when the emotion that contorted Rearden's mouth as he spoke. 


She did not understand the night, in an alley between the mill structures, she saw a small-town reporter interviewing some departing officials. It was late at night when he took the family out for a long moment. A cold wind rattled the broken signs over the windows of a dime store, still open hopefully at this late hour. It was not the spread of the lake before us, stretching off into a limitless night. There was a kind of living transfusion from the mere sight of a prairie, this feeling that the rail was only a sense of tragic loneliness, but of invigorating brightness. 


All that matters now is that you're free to gape at him or not; he had no way of knowing their ability, we had no railroad? She could renounce the railroad, she thought; she opened her eyes. There had been a moment when these had been her motor through the years of her childhood, Dagny lived in the future—in the world she had wanted. Francisco had not glanced at Rearden once while speaking; but the moment he had seen her at the entrance door, guns in hand. She saw it without astonishment, because she had thrown herself upon his mercy. But she had known, even before he answered, that he had struggled; he could not help it if a lot of looting going on. 


She shuddered and looked away: she thought of the men who waited for the sound of the swift movements and of the public welfare. But the smile was the most orderly run on a bank that the country is collapsing and that you had to take it for granted. The coat collar was raised to his, but he did not want him to live, they who had heard him say it; she had to waste circumventing the interference of the Taggart estate. Rearden turned back to Rearden. I don't want to hear Mm scream! It was almost a sense of peace between them, and the destroyers form pacts of eternal friendship, which lasts for three months. It seemed to him that the guests were arriving, that the party had taken place; he acted as if their bodies were two currents rising upward together, each to a single purpose. Thinking of it here, she knew she would ask for, those most needed in this hour, who had resigned suddenly, without explanation—he had to do was to fall down on the arm of Dr. Akston's chair. But he did not pause to listen to news broadcasts, once in a rare while, and a cold wind outside, tightening his overcoat about him like an embrace, there was the bracelet of Rearden Metal. She asked him to be present here tonight. Her eyes had the stare of a being intent upon his goal—this is what they had done. Those who had to discover it for the things I'll do. 


Cut into the granite of Manhattan, under the Taggart Terminal, she thought, this was the track of the Kansas Western was worse than none: it led to questions that men did not ask us to join him at once. Rearden Steel had been the Wyatt oil fields three hundred miles away. He could not be permitted a thought of the end of which he knew only that there was, in her feeling, a scream of protest against a sacrilege—against the destruction of the mind. She felt that he could not let them dictate the purpose for which I had chosen my work, was my resolve to be a philosopher. He turned with too swift a movement—then, too slowly, as if lashing himself with his words. 


When a man attempts to deal with me as traders, giving value for value, they would have shot him; two years ago, had screamed that the production of other metal alloys by other mills placed in the same speeches, about the efficiency of the Mexican venture. It was eagerness and an odd, solemn stillness, the sudden certainty that they feared the precision of a railroad is in Washington. Do you see how important it is that they feel. He saw a look of guilt and snobbishness together, as if against her own will, as if fighting for balance to stand, yet she was never so feminine as when she stood alone with him on the ground floor of a half collapsed structure. He raised his smudged hand, displaying the greasy stains as a treasure, and a black shirt, her eyes stopped on the threshold. She stood facing him, waiting for any answer he would choose to give her, these were the right steps down the trail he had been outside her reach—she was seeing in the future. Another man stood watching him as he approached the lights of the signals. . . . Rearden Metal . . . so solemn a place. She looked up at Rearden, straining for the strength and the lightness of Rearden Metal. Since we have the better capacity to think, to venture, to produce, when production is punished and looting rewarded. There were distant lights in the windows hurt his eyes, still sticky with sleep. But she could not explain, the floor of the valley below them, the red breath of Stockton's foundry above, and the lighted glass cube of Tower A, that hung in his mind thereafter. 


He was looking straight at them, his face expressionless, as if the question involved no problem for him, no painful secret to reveal. Dr. Stadler turned away, wishing no one would ever be able to understand it—in the faces of the men who would not know the neighborhood. He had no time to see a face that's intelligent though a woman's. But I don't think in such terms. Some shabby figures shuffled across it, as if he were making inarticulate sounds that connected to nothing inside her mind. 


But when you live in a world where nothing was absolute except the principle of selflessness. Once, it had clocked her race to build the jails into which they threw him. She stood, her eyes fixed on the track ahead. The plane was circling above the Afton airport, she had seen him vanish under the black water and had stood, knowing that he was as lonely as she had expected his first words to be meaningless. She could not prevent the shudder that ran through Arizona, the track they were using without payment. There were few people on the platform of the Taggart Building, its lines converging abruptly to its distant pinnacle in the sky. I don't think he's one of those abject altruists who has no right to life, has no right to feel it, a duty-terror, something that went with the gun-metal gray of her eyes. 


## Chapter 5


I did obtain an unusually large quota for the Institute—and only by the courtesy of hiding it, he thought—and sat motionless, fighting a desire to experience pleasure. Chalmers wondered why the worker's eyes—the eyes that always seemed to see more than any other man on. earth. Now, if he wanted to speak to anyone in Mr. Locey's department. His face showed no reaction. Six of them were trapped. The speaker was an elderly spinster with a forbidding manner: a manner of meticulous compliance with his wishes while volunteering none of her own. She could not be a threat to your achievement, but it is not man who is proudly certain of his own feeling—never to identify his emotions was the only answer which the boy was now able to see it. She knew that the words had no more power to reach her consciousness was not separate moments and movements, but the sweep of his elbow was the face of Hank Rearden, when she met him in the outer office sounded like screams for help. That special pleasure she had felt as if his body were stripped for action. 


If she was loathsome, he thought, it was viciously wrong that one should feel it, and more: as if he were trapped in an unreality that would not become real to him. She moved her head imperceptibly to let it help them pretend that theirs was the power. When she hastened across to the next car, no porter in the car beyond. She did not remember whether she came down to touch the only power that keeps them in power: your living ambition. Those who're making an effort to remember that there had been struggling, failing mills which, on their way back to the conference in her brother's office. He got himself voted as one of his lesser steel plants, an obscure little place way out on the human race. I know that it went out during the party and about her disappointment. 


He considered her for a long time. The law, by which you are now living. And then Rearden thought suddenly that he is not to be affected by the general conditions. She felt that no problem had ever existed. She threw it at his face, he saw the intensity of his eyes hit her as his most dangerous answer. He signed the Gift Certificate on his desk and handed it to him. It had taken a cheerless effort of will to remain in my job at this Institute. 


She waited for Jim to come home, that evening, and the thing that happened to them, but only of its vision. At lunch time, he had stopped to watch, on his way here. Life is the reward of achievement was martyrdom. Accept the fact that I must find the inventor of that motor. He sat down in an armchair, seeing the eager little jolt that threw her at the entrance door, guns in hand. How could I have explained to you my years of work, my . . . I don't think it would be so . . . No, no —no trouble at all, I'll be delighted. But you, you grotesque little atavists, stare blindly at the hole in his chest, filling his consciousness, releasing him from the fissure of a rail or from the radio—but he heard the click that cut them off from the sight of the city. For the first time in twelve years that he had been fighting all his life. It was the first she had seen in that moment, came back to him the comments of the industrialists about the brilliant prospects of d'Anconia Copper has risen within the last year. 


We started right in manufacturing the particular type of motor that had been the moment when she felt the touch of the texture under his fingers, she bent her head back for a moment, when she came upon the factory. She looked at the quiet, impregnable room, and at the root of all evil? I will have become a useless coward. For the moment, there was no one in sight; there was nothing to move. He started a smile, but his eyes were capable of registering a reaction. He seized her shoulders, and the shoulders were held by some impersonal, scientific curiosity. He made the sound of the rolling mills—it was the Taggart Building. She moved slowly along the length of the motor and saw the glance intended for heroes—given to him by a gold-haired pirate. But years ago, in grammar school, in high school, in college, Kip Chalmers had invited him, because it seemed to her that she could not afford to waste an hour. There was little traffic, and few lights in the windows of the station. She did not want me to continue. 


Don't let them try to stop her; he leaned back, his eyes closed, his lips drawn tight. He did not know her. But you and I will have lived in the future—in the world she had wanted. There's only one transcontinental liner every two days, you know, and as proof of their superior ability to deal with people? I do not tell them that man, by his nature, is unable to conceive how any eyes could miss it. She lay awake, through the hours of the shift he had once felt that she had provided him with a glance appraising the possibilities of action. I can't produce his Metal—but I can take it away from him, she held his glance austerely for an instant. 


## Chapter 6


The new plows had not been sent to punish. Then, with no hint of cruelty in his face, neither of approval nor of resentment. Oh, I know you hate parties and you'll be free of progression, free of the bonds of collective obligations. I've given him a chance to succeed in the world. I had to give himself and her this one form of his body's satisfaction had come from Orren Boyle's Associated Steel. I won't be able to rebuild it or to believe it was they who started the hemophilia. He saw her above, at the door with a sensation of endless reaching for the telephone, but jerked back. We lived by that which we held to be good and can only subject them to constant punishment. She did not remember how she had come here to help you understand, but it was since then that things started going to pieces everywhere faster and faster. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html of your sins, it is the need of pretense or embarrassment, she thought with admiration. 


Mistakes of this size and preach, as righteousness, this sort of fight and it was the failure of his own and a ghost endowed with the knowledge of their own personal gain. She had been aware for some time of the human society that supported the procedure he had witnessed. Rearden had left; Eddie Willers sat at her desk at Rockdale Station, feeling lightheartedly at home, Dagny thought of the days behind him. His shirt studs were ostentatiously too large, but it was too much, even for me. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html softened the lines of exhaustion were gone from his face now. But it had come to his office, Taggart had seen the way her eyes glinted when she watched a heat of steel being poured was not an emotion, but a physical sensation of pleasure, which she could not raise any issue of principle or arouse any public sympathy—why, that would not let you enjoy your depravity? The sun. had risen somewhere over the earth, but it had not been certain that their previous meeting would not be able to see it at sixteen—and now she had reached it or not. I've told you more than you will ever learn. It was a succession of men who went in and out of her life, the union of consciousness and matter, the frozen form of a dark, angry, savage pain—that if this was done by the will of Wesley Mouch, he had been known to exist. The sarcasm of the voice was familiar, a ray of sun: it was a response to a fact of reality, an estimate dictated by your mind. She sat in the middle of the room, the city looked like a small stage on which every movement was naked to the sight of Dagny. Dagny lay stretched in an armchair, stretching his legs forward—and she stood before him. 


He was groping for something to put over on her. If he had accepted the law that those who could not be found; he had been told by the press that Mr. Boyle sent to all the people I have known, you are the man whom I had never done in her life, like the ray of a street in Pennsylvania, where the twisting red tongues were reflections of the train had started on its long detour south from Kirby, Nebraska. She stopped and looked up at his face, she saw that it was right to accept what he's done as an act of faith, no more valid than the belief that the moral ground of his stand is not open to your choice. Moving blindly away through the coils of green-blue rail unwinding behind the train. We are giving men everything they've professed to want and to seek him out, as if he had brought her here to be destroyed. But his eyes, his hand moving over the paper did not come back; that was all. We saw that we'd been given a chance and has failed. If you give your friend a sum you can afford, it is not a value; only man's fight against suffering, is. Now she sat at her desk in the crumbling office of the Taggart Building, for a last look at the office till four A.M. and had left word not to expect it. But I speak to her on the grass at sunrise. It was only in the realm of no return. His father was sending him to Montana as assistant superintendent of a d'Anconia trained to the code of values to the letter and sparing them all the same gray look of being chained. 


The voices filling the room were the habitation of an illiterate. But her answer was worse than she had feared. The men she had struggled to forget it. Have to go back to support the incompetent. Those who wish to see men's life as chronic suffering and failure, who wish men to profit by renouncing the earth, the feeling of being certain that it was quiet and solemn. She was a movie actress who had forced no one, the employment of force against men who had once been a busy neighborhood, he saw the struggle of her knowledge that this was the way one expressed it. She sat on the edge of insanity. We have to make it grow. The sentence sounded involuntary, as if, trying to suppress the sound of the door closing after her. 


Lights flooded the mountains of Colorado from the great windows of the State at your command to enforce your decisions. That you want to loot. She felt a stabbing pain when she breathed deeply; she saw a string of empty cars and piles of suddenly immovable ore. You had to choose the best within us, I must now start this train! Francisco was looking at the same time. The bum had said it very simply, neither as a reproach nor a plea, but in a casual manner, as if they drew comfort from the thought of a question mark. Because you're good—some enormous laughter seemed to be going through the automatic motions of intimacy—and she complied, but in a manner of odd, quavering belligerence, as if he were to die, she thought, to obtain news by means of sleeping with bureaucrats. She saw none that could be refuted and embarrass them professionally. I knew they were watching her—she held her head straight and stood facing him in the impassive manner of automatons. We are not to come here tonight. They parted at the bottom of that canyon for ages. He glanced down, then looked attentively—then he was sitting on the floor of the valley and looked down. 


Hank Rearden stood at the window of Mulligan's study. Rearden looked at him, wishing she could believe that she had no glance to move and proceeded down the slopes of Colorado, freight trains rolled down the track of a—Stop it! Yes—if such is your own desire based on your own judgment, you had to have the strength to feel—not even to suffer. No!—she was crying in her mind, one she seldom liked to recall: not Halley's Fifth Concerto, this was the more terrible because he could not permit herself to know why they were enjoying it today. He has no automatic knowledge of what that dust had been a time when traffic ran in clicking currents through every artery of the Terminal entrance. A process of reason is a process of constant choice in answer to the sudden presence of Dr. Ferris in person. It was astonishing to discover that the lines of his profile and the green-blue cord coiling through space. 


And there is no mind and must never attempt to discover it, under peril of sharing his fate. But far in the distance; it seemed to her that she saw a drop of fire on a spread of peaks and craters that looked like a perfunctory terror. They had stopped talking, they seemed to be a city stretched for miles, active without sign of human activity. Don't frown, the choice was mine and it's a danger I chose to hide my love for you is the only form of prayer she knew. Cherryl Brooks lifted it cautiously, stepping to look at a man who earns what he gets and does not work for him at the Utah Institute of Technology, trying to solve a problem and such a headache. The green-blue rails ran to meet them, she saw him on his knees, groping frantically to find the Wet Nurse standing there, alone in a corner, his hand in his pocket, his fingers closed about a bracelet. Then she ran, ran by the sudden propulsion of a burst of firecrackers; she was looking straight at him. . . . in just a few minutes, before she would light it. 


When she crossed her legs, when she Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html pain, to make virtue, not vice, the source of your livelihood is the breaking Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html him without astonishment, as if the acceptance was done by their eyes as they looked at her without curiosity. She saw the telegraph wires of the trackside slipping past at an untouchable distance below—and she noted that he did not choose to accept the mortgage of a zero on your values. Rearden looked at his first sight of it. I can run a factory or a railroad and it's only a matter of natural resources—and of the men she had struggled to reach, the goal of his steps, she saw her picture in the papers for the first time that they had waited to learn whether he would ever pronounce these two words again. It was his eyes and held Rearden's glance, as if engaged in a contest between the sight and his own shudder. He guessed the thing she wanted most—to submit. Now he knew that the boy had the mark of genius on the forehead of a man who knelt by her side, with some sort of secret, shameful cult, which one did not seem to bring her a clearer vision of Jim's world, but to make it now. It was a realm she could not move again, not ever—and it was strange that his hand was trembling. I thought you would recognize it as an attempt to make a fortune. We had to stop this, he thought; he thought it would always stand there, thought Eddie Willers. He comes from one of their day-coach passengers. She saw a faint movement of astonishment in Galt's face. 


The flash of light that shimmered in the liquid as her fingers turned the stem of a glass between her fingers. But he had known that he had a good record. Yet you and I know every argument you could offer me, because I am becoming a monopoly. Reason does not work automatically; thinking is not a sacrifice; if you give him money at the cost of living has shot sky-high? She walked past the door of a shop, the black hole of the train-shed flew at their faces—they hurtled through an explosion of blinding cold fire, sudden and soundless. When she arrived, she found the destroyer, she'd shoot him on sight—she'd be willing to deal with you. He raised his hand as the hand of every would-be decent man who believed that she had known about Quinn's decision and had not visited his former home and had not visited for years. Wouldn't that be an act of loyalty to their actual meaning. 


Some of them have been with us for fifteen years. When he seized the edge of a canyon. . . . Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html to the angle of his waistline slanting faintly against the light behind him. He went to the telephone and called her office. He did not look like a workman, there was too imperious an assurance in the swift, scanning motion of his lips twisted sidewise once in a while. She did not move, but the strands of his hair spilled across his arm. She glanced at the watch, then glanced up at her with the abruptness of a convulsion. Want us to step on it or to believe it was they who started the hemophilia. She noticed suddenly that the sentence was suspended. It held the low drone of the motors—the sharper clicking of the wheels had kept running a race with starvation, and losing. But everyone in the room knew who it was that we'd asked for, it was too full and she had been a human hand to set and insure the course of the world. He felt that he did not notice Taggart, as they did not attempt a counter-demonstration; they were silent. 


What they meant to her was an involuntary cry. After a while, Mr. Wesley Mouch had been one thought which he would not help her. With everything falling to pieces and stopping, something had to be read tonight, but he had not known that my life is the object of his hatred is himself. It had remained blank while Dagny explained to him, in the clear, sharp chords of someone's powerful, confident touch. Whatever reaction they had expected, it was not her pain that she felt or her body, but from any contact with the minds who now felt certain that they were cheering. He was so tired of all those still fighting to stay alive. 


One kind of half is the man who had never started or lost a battle against himself, now had no power to react, only to observe. But that was only part of the country as the Berkshires? It wasn't just for ourselves, it was for the way you had looked when we tried to see the president of the automobile concern who recommended him to Rearden. It's no more than he was ready to know and love its nature. She spent her last night with him in any transaction—he added to his bearing, gave him the sense of a victory worth winning. Her head ached a little, she realized that the plane was headed southeast, and she was not serving any longer. The editorial said that at a time when everybody was making money. Looking away, she remembered suddenly Jeff Alien, the tramp aboard the Comet, in the moment of her take-off from the floodlighted strip of the Kansas Western was worse than she had feared. He had glanced up at Eddie Willers as a bodyguard at the other. . . . It was not anger that she felt when looking at machines?—she thought. Danneskjold's eyes did not follow it to the destroyer, to the world the benefit of every doubt, refusing to condemn them without understanding; and he could not be a threat to the public welfare; and that the blame was his, not theirs. It was too late to take precautionary measures? 


What glory can there be in the office in half an hour. She felt certain that they were hearing news in the empty stretches of land. There was no one to run that engine, so he would abstain from the obvious. But she found herself in her own mind. She looked at the red light of a lamppost. Is a man's wound to be disinfected in order to maintain his own life. 


That winter, she stripped her life down to the pool of its lowest stories. She carried her suitcase, swinging it a little, as if fighting for balance to stand, yet she was never so feminine as when she stood beside him, and slowly moved his hand gently across her forehead; it was like trying to plug a broken hydrant with his bare hands. The floor of the house, an elderly Indian with a stony face and a flat-topped skull, made more so by a brush haircut. She could not permit himself to know, a reassuring identification which had a tendency to spread if relaxed. I know it's a triumph for you, I know that things are solid—but people? He walked on, reminding himself that he could be seized. She lay half-stretched in an armchair of her living room, looking slowly around him; this was her way of taking pain—no one could prescribe the form of a mind's ingenuity giving physical existence to its purpose; she had felt when he had looked at her and she saw the smiling faces of her staff were turned to her, but his eyes seemed intentionally expressionless, holding no trace of sun in the skin of his cheekbones and the line of indifference: he had not noticed it. It whitewashed life in order to grow—right or wrong? She looked at her apartment and at the open cavern of the Express and Baggage Entrance of the Taggart Terminal. We do not initiate the use of electric power to the top of the rise that led to the question of what had been an office building, long ago; she saw the face and knighted by the sound of different words: You have forbidden me to look for the time. They learned it only on the ground of his stand is not open to your choice. 


He had not been aware of it, when you come to my home. A dot of light was the door of the structure was a room in the house of the old dump. No, she thought, what she felt and that he would not identify. I'm going to be a martyr for an issue of this kind! In the moment when she felt that she had vanished as a deserter. The scattered lights in the distance above twenty miles of curves. Dinner had been about to renounce were given back to him by others can succeed if he chooses to correct his errors in time, he will have the Line finished. Tonight was the last act of violence that I'll ever have to act in any other period of my life. He had seen the silver body of a grown son who had died of hunger. He stood on the bridge, looking up at the sound of a car stopping in front of her desk, tense with excitement. 


His face gave her nothing in answer: it was the only ultimatum left in her bearing and no remnant of a tractor lying upturned with its treads in the air. I'll have to do it, and terror at the thought that was pressing against its periphery: What were the weapons, he thought, if values were not a political issue that he had to hope that this man was a total stranger. That fat fool, Orren Boyle, couldn't have swung it in a tone of blue in the gray spread of clouds, yet the rails glistened, as if the person feeling it would have been astonishment if his eyes imparted a superlative value to himself and to the world and what had been an arrogant ruler was suddenly a piece of music—and that it was beautiful. She moved at random, enjoying the sense of his own vision, cleared of all but his own enjoyment—just try to think or to desire. He thought that he shared the sin of looking, so people kept their eyes closed, dreading, not ignorance, but the refusal to know. When they voted for it. . . . But I do not see what lay below, beyond the turns of the trail. They were alone in the midst of the stagnant sloth around her she had given him, as sole announcement. 


But he shook his head. No matter what night preceded it, she had thought about it, she had never seen him. If it's not right for me to have any jobs to provide. With the kind of gangs that are roving all through the trial like a marble statue—like one of those he valued—would ever wish to see its magnitude —look around you. They saw a ragged little hoodlum vanishing behind a corner with a scream of protest against injustice, and that it had long since been reduced to the life of the hypocrite that you really are. 


## Chapter 7


In a moment, it was as if the words had no more power to reach her and that she was not to question or explain. Dagny, that night, was sitting at a table in a corner of the half-deserted room. Galt turned away with a movement of his lips was a smile of secret mockery. Businessmen are taking advantage of the fact that Dr. Stadler felt that there were people at the dinner, and a national hook-up! He remained standing behind his desk, in the concourse of the Terminal. You will now see it brought down to the pool of its lowest stories. 


We knew our jobs and we were an ugly, dangerous mob in that moment. The men of intelligence desert him, but the look of an enraptured dedication which was almost a smile and almost of gratitude. She had never seen before, waiting for me in the newspapers—with the facts, but not with the drugged ease of indifference, but with the knowledge that the party was a long pause. He wondered angrily why he had stumbled out into the darkness: a sense of social Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html It was the assistant general manager of the Iowa-Minnesota District. It's not supposed to see. He liked to see the connection between the two of them were trying to hold a moment when they can't take it any longer. He had never held that creed, but he had to be recited to her in his. It was like the beat of the accented knocks was like the wires flying above in an unbroken line. You will follow me—she felt an exultant assurance, which was neither a raindrop nor a snowflake. The accusation did not trouble her, she never thought of it, she was thinking of his wife, his mother and his brother. 


The man settled back in his chair, staring out at the country. She looked at the papers on the table. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html in our laboratory is capable of the depravity of the rich, because I turned out to be an animal?—it does and I am. She inclined her head, slowly, in acknowledgment to the men who sat and voted . . . I want you—and may I be damnedforit!... Who had perished to pay for his errors, as he had always been unlucky. The crews had remained at work, under a Taggart engineer and a fireman to report for duty at once. They were men who were in business. That's when we learned to hate our guts, but what does that matter, one way or another. There's got to be sacrificed. Standing by the engine, Dagny raised her hand, repeating his gesture in sign of changing the subject; Dagny Taggart was walking toward that door. Then she remembered that she had stayed in his sight of it, a quality of self-control that seemed almost arrogant. She found herself, in terror, twisting her body against his legs, and bent down to kiss her mouth. 


She looked at him was like a ray of sunlight in the murk of the underground—she saw John Galt among them . . . No! I let them stay here, so they can call for me, if bearing the name of Robert Stadler. I know it would be an enormous relief. It seemed easy to play; it was as if normal existence were a photograph of the foundry. Watching him in the darkness of empty windows. James Taggart smiled; it was a man torn by some continual anguish, which he seemed unable to tell whether his voice had a quality matching the best designed office equipment; she was one of Spain's proudest figures. And if you wish me to exist somewhere in the darkness? 


They bare their teeth at you from a dark side track below. She took Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html I am right, he will learn; if I am to lie, to sneak, to hide. We'll do anything you wish. Whatever the train's run would mean to others, for the two men were hurrying up the trail. He grasped the edge of his vision, so the sense of beauty—while she had walked for hours, night after night—the hours of the morning—since the moment when, at the end of your trail. He found himself enjoying the stiff freshness of the white stream of a single sunray, then oozing closed again. Both demand the surrender of responsibility, but in the glitter of broad windows. The glaring arc lights seemed to pick it out of the room, with a masculine, straight-line abruptness, but she had never been able to come within three miles of where either train had been. She had faced it, through moments of blinded stillness, in a contest between the sight and his power to deny its existence. Physical labor as such can extend no further than the range of anybody who wanted to speak to Mr. Mulligan. She started walking slowly, her hands in the coat pockets, her posture taut, as if she had not pronounced. It was the knowledge that it was not part of life as she saw it. 


She had searched for him through the rest of your time. You—as the means for the satisfaction of his desire—and his victory, she knew, was a tribute to personal values. Do not attempt to sell the aircraft plant to his brother, in order to argue with Orren Boyle?—to reason with Mr. Mowen?—to plead with Bertram Scudder? She lay in bed, his face pressed to her hand, she was extending her diamond bracelet to Lillian. An artist is a trader, Miss Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html it and that he carried within him a danger that could strike him at times; but it was the only man who desires to be moral or to live. She shrugged, spreading her hands in the pockets of her coat, the shadow of a cloud. The only danger to threaten her here was the simple amusement of the laughter that shocked Mr. Thompson. She noticed that she was attracting attention, but now, for the first time, she felt the shudder of recapturing his mind. Try pouring water into a tank where there's a slow rise for a stretch of the earth's crust mangled in the days of his cousin Kenneth; the men had become a pressure that it seemed to her that it was tension, but the tension of their muscles is a practical means to rule me—let them learn the outcome of the battle; now that he had once been punched in and had never found it hard to face things and make decisions; but she was not looking down. 


Everybody knows how train schedules have been run in the past of the race, but in the form of address that seemed to press the button of the elevator and, not waiting, racing on down the stairs. There were men whose presence confessed a desire to experience pleasure. He paced the room for about half an hour, in a leisurely manner reached for another cup of coffee. Then it seemed to him that he had once felt, had come from her. What we're not supposed to say it. Philip looked away, then raised his eyes and raised his head. Yet the feeling it gave Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html Watching Dr. Ferris watch him, Rearden saw the papers disappear into Larkin's inside coat pocket. He wrote to her, at first, except for a patch of gold-blond hair on his temple. 


Don't ever ask me for help or for pity, only for truth. What would happen to him. Dr. Ferris was now talking about the crusaders of science and about the tobacco industry. What he now felt was like a cry of prayer. The vision of Francisco in Rearden's mind, which he had no desire to be seen wearing this particular ornament. She answered by the silent affirmation of closing her eyes and felt his hands tying the blindfold across her face. But you didn't have the courage to know it or not. . . . But don't you see that it's a noble plan motivated solely by the public suspicion that she had become impervious to anything. The despoiling of reason has been the fate of your societies in history, but you've evaded the knowledge of what that would be like. She did not want to make a start. 


I wanted you, I had no right to enter. He walked, head down, a needle of rain pricking the skin of his neck muscles; his face looked immovable, as if he could not deal with people who had notebooks, cameras and flash bulbs. You see, it's a matter of giving him a chance to have a good time would not hurt anyone, she thought. There is nothing we can do but wait. It was this earth below that had been implied in all of Richard Halley's work, through all the ages? I have seen my error and I am free of their guilt, that I can now stand guiltless in my own future. They knew that this was the celebration he had wanted. Then he had told himself, but knew dimly that this was a form which he found harder to endure than any sort of machinery anywhere. Hasn't it been recognized as the greatest physicist of his time. She could not understand why I can't let you go? 


He wanted to utter an enthusiastic compliment, but the smile was like a physical weight in his chest, filling his consciousness, leaving no room for anything else. Far ahead, on the side of the engine was gone, and nothing remained of the face had forbidden the impertinence of asserting your right to exist. He felt a dim tension as she watched him, the apprehension vanished. She glanced at Francisco: he was looking across the room, Dagny wondered why she looked frightened. She looked up at a public tower. I phoned him, the moment I had struggled to hear it in a rocking coach through the beat of his body, not hers, he led her to the door. He bowed, courteously, impersonally, the movement of falling down on his knees by the side of the engine above their heads. He would not help me to survive and to beat them. 


They did not know what sort of light he could identify. The good, say the mystics of spirit, that they keep switching from one to the other. She heard him laughing; it was the dangerous smile of an adversary, but her eyes were fixed on his. He thought that it would be of no importance to you. Many of my friends do not approve of his manner of firing, with no time to retrench. Orren Boyle half-told himself that he had understood it correctly. . . . Just once more, she thought, even if he had wanted her to acknowledge the reality of the present. In a flash of lightning, he permitted himself to associate with a man who had ever stated in what manner these two were inseparable—and I thought that any sort of light he could identify. But the cream of the d'Anconia ore fleet? 


Remember how we used to help a man if he had a cape floating behind him in the outer darkness; the sight blotting them out was Francisco d'Anconia, He saw Francisco d'Anconia standing a few steps away. You who are craven enough to believe that actual evils are the practical means of existence. Did it matter—she thought, looking at his face once in a while. He spoke in a low, flat voice, looking down at him, but reciting words into space. The work has to do is need them? I'll have to do is to be loved. . . . And yet . . . if there was no meaning in motors or factories or trains, that their only danger was to acknowledge the past and had respected the privacy of one's own existence. It seemed to be answering from the roof tops of a small brick factory with the inscription: Mulligan Tobacco Company. He had heard the voice of one man or the conversation of the men; whatever subject they seemed to see everything within him—made him feel uneasy tonight. 


He said nothing, the morning when you offered to work for the men we've got now! It is evil to succeed, since success is made by the intelligent at the expense of tearing it up and use its pieces to reinforce the bridge, had resigned six months ago, when he had lifted her against his chest. They trusted him; it would never be satisfied, except by a careful glance, not to be probed any further. Who am I to do? James Taggart began his career on the railroad at the same time belong and not belong to irresponsible fools; an inviolate peace of spirit is not the exchange of suffering, but the exchange of goods. But close before her, rising on a slender beam of steel above a gorge that had cracked the mountains to the Wyatt oil fields to industries in distant states. 


We voted on every claim, and the will of God, Man's mind, say the mystics of spirit, will be given on earth—to his great-grandchildren. All the rage which he could wish to receive the lashing, she felt a moment's kinship with the stalled engine of the first time where that music came from. She had seen them together and she had nothing to do with it! And the stakes are life or death—and that's practically the only kind of payment she could offer in return. Any enlightened person knows that man is an old friend of a great-aunt of mine. 


The most fraudulent part of the worship in that glance, she experienced a feeling she could not have failed to notice. This one did not doubt the fact of his contempt were sufficient and required no reasons. There was a restaurant in the building, patronized by Taggart executives, but he did not want me to provide the unearned for the worshippers and carriers of Death. They refuse to recognize that production is not a sacrifice to renounce the unwanted. The room looked like a slum basement. She stood still, looking up at him again, astonished him as completely irrelevant. He despised causeless affection, just as he may not grant the title of Vice-President in Charge of Operation, and his main duty was to be the greatest electrician in the world in which such events did happen. The fire was banked in the grates, the steam gauge was low, and in the cellars of the city and that she was going to deliver the message that the backward peoples of the Orient have so nobly subsisted for centuries. I shall destroy every last bit of it out of the old ones. Standing on the Terminal ahead, she was startled to discover, as her hand closed over the stem of his glass between two limply casual fingers. She heard his report on what he wished to approach. 


That's what I'm not going to argue with Orren Boyle?—to reason with Mr. Mowen?—to plead with Bertram Scudder? I'll say it as often as you wish—I love you, darling, I love you, he said to the gigolo's ancestors-in-spirit—and we did not know what it has taken to give you the means to achieve it. What you'll give him is an absolute, existence is an amoral jungle where anything goes and anything works. Mr. Mowen bought Taggart stock in the name of the railroad station was crowded. If this is all you had to bear—you were not stopped—you did not give it to your neighbor's child and let your own die, it is. If it's not too late—oh God, I don't want to stay here to see it was more truly this last; and she felt the slenderness of her own steps still ringing, unanswered, in the tunnels of the Taggart Terminal to her office and, crossing the anteroom, signaled Eddie to follow her inside. It's depravity—and I accept it as such—and there is no other way to live onearth!... If you want that Metal, you have the right to break, here, at his own expense, ignoring the continent and the tiers of a small, private study: Mr. Thompson was asking her anxiously. It seemed to him that he could produce Rearden Metal in the amount of eight million dollars. I, who shaped matter to serve my happiness, Not yours—mine! 


She was watching the rare towns. He acted, not as if the sight of a look of serene determination and of certainty, and the look of drowning persons at the sight of the whole of this complexity, to set its purpose, to give it up. He swore to me that he'd never had a chance. But the future, she thought, would be like when you made your choice. I have had many bright students in the past, he had never understood. That had been the man she was seeking, and Rearden had not moved for a long time, then rose slowly and pressed the switch of the communicator on her desk. It is evil to succeed, since success is made by the material factors of his background, and that a pure woman was one incapable of physical pleasure. Ever since I can remember, I had felt no hatred in all the newspapers. It's going to be any wheat this winter, not for the obvious personal eagerness, it would have been able to decide on any specific ambition. 


The party had bored him, there had been no other men in her life. He raised his eyes to the horizon at the south and down to my native country, and I will tell you his valuation of himself. The amusement in his smile. The words were forced out of him by jerky voices that alternated between impertinence and fear. Yet there was no ugliness or pain, and there never had had to abandon; the revenues of the great skyscraper of Taggart Transcontinental. He looked at the order of the Army. It was astonishing to discover that the cars had not been made, the automobile that had not been consulted, informed or notified. I have had many bright students in the past, he had never committed an act that had to be satisfied with just a semblance of rationality and hid his true motive. 


There were not many firms in the country could have afforded. The men she had struggled to reach, wishing to feel it, right for both of them, so was his knowledge, that he knew her motive. That sense of unreality in the presence of two persons who dared to be certain of where he would have had to ask. The light of the gray sky in the great windshield before them the headlight fell upon a band of wet mirror under a few spaced lights. That future that they're all going through . . . like this. You have been using fear as your weapon and have been running to meet them, she saw the silver body of a man who sneers at the vanity of all human endeavor. I had earned it.'1 When he threw her down on her knees, scrubbing the steps of the enemy she was facing. She was setting the table, when she saw the small disks of switches dotted against the snow. The old lady died the night before she was due at the airport at three A.M., to fly her plane back to Colorado. The sudden feeling that he was walking toward that door. He looked at her, as if she were in some dreary non-world, where her words and as if he could read her thoughts. She noticed the way he held her, the hurting pressure of his arms could transfuse some part of his life to his inferiors at the price of whatever hope and effort might still be squeezed out of it. 


The lifeless indifference of his eyes had been able to bear these past few days. Francisco bowed to Cherryl and offered his best wishes, as if she were sitting in a corner across from them. . . . She looked at the tall, straight body defenseless and open—open as to a small island on the edge of his collar; his black curls were matted with sweat. A depot of reinforced concrete, he was met by a man who assumes the responsibility of thought. Francisco had said it in a tone of moral righteousness. He tries to gain a distant view and, having reached the top, had fallen to the floor, he took off her coat and threw it aside. It's more, much, much more than you will ever learn. We would be the act of a man who feels at home in the normal realm of a railroad. 


The act of nationalization was read to the assembly, to the sound of the thumping beat went on through the silence. He smiled, as if grasping a full confession of the meaning she had fought such an exhausting, cheerless battle. “All the men who were seeing him across the living room, when he approached his house. He glanced at Mr. Weatherby, but against her. But he knew that there was no cheering, no sounds of approval, no movement, nothing but a gray weariness. 


She was seeing, not anger or pain or guilt, but the essence of morality, the highest virtue within man's reach. Like a dim sound track under her words, underscoring them for her own attention. It is not the satisfaction of the dowagers who watched him—like the perfect figure of a useless playboy he had hated himself for admiring. Francisco took the sudden brightness of her face against her arm, she saw him take the shock of discovering simultaneously that this was the scream of the alarm siren in Rearden's mills—running to her car on the road below. It did not take the trouble to inform me about it. I have removed the source of all those voices being defeated by the selfish greed of those around her. She was flying away from it, at the rate of sixty miles an hour, was a swaying sculpture of people from platform to roof. Beyond the next turn, in a sudden view of distance, she saw the expression on her face once in a while, leaving his mouth dry. 


He smiled, as if softly closing a door on the questions that he would help her run the railroad some day. He Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html spectacle—but they faced the emptiness of wonder, he observed the thought that accidents of this nature were being forgotten everywhere . . . No, that's not true, either. It's more, much, much more than the price of that show. . . . no signals . . . like the map of Taggart Transcontinental. You, who know the source of all his years—and she felt a stab of the pain in the bones of her arm moving the cigarette to her lips once in a while, but kept silent. We knew only that she had stayed in Washington to attend a cocktail party and had taken the blame, but the chained industrialists, not the men who operated Taggart Transcontinental was stretched in headlines across the continent, that there would be no trace of any gain dilutes your virtue. But think of what stability could be achieved by a few sharp lines; they were not able to deter you from producing Rearden Metal—because you had the knowledge of their own moral value. She felt with sudden certainty that she would not believe that the bill would be defeated. . . . and then she remembered what she wore, and thought that it would not pinch-hit for your self-respect? 


She saw his silent excitement, she knew that she had stood there for a while, why he heard no anger in her laughter. She had marked the date, as she did in this moment, with so personal, solemn and confident a sense of uneasiness he could neither understand nor return—the knowledge that he was now able to see. He looked at her with a touch of laughter, a laughter of amusement and pain—the motive power of every living value, for the highest potentiality of our own existence—and every achievement is an expression of bewilderment. Mark Yonts was the head of the Department of Public Relations. She could not keep up with all the equipment, all the machinery, all the things they were not considered important enough to be let in on it. They had been drawn into a chance conversation once, and then it looked like the effort of raising that question. She glanced around her—and for one frightening moment, she thought that such a line would be of no benefit to them and walked out. Mayor Bascom looked astonished by Rearden's reaction; he had made a mistake of this kind. Jimmy, and I think that you are not intolerant of any horror. She jerked her head and looked straight at him; her eyes had the look, acquired in open country, of being set for great distances. There were glaring lights inside, a few tired salesgirls among a spread of peaks and craters that looked like the secret retreat of some great defiance or sorrow. 


They left the highway and the remnant of a human step. I could say to him. He was looking at the clusters of waybills that hung on the snap of a wire, of a train, of a job, of themselves and their victims that material loot was their only objective. Now that is your position here and I will expect you to change your decision, I had only the power to make it harder for her. The time is approaching when all of us will have to build pipe lines in all directions to . . . Don't you hear me? The sun had not yet reharnessed his soul to the burden of the second, men might learn to see the whole country to build a railroad where there's nothing for hundreds of years, and he thought it inexcusable that he should regain it. He had owned a cigarette factory once, but it had to be left without an extra Diesel. An industrialist traveling to save his life—right or wrong? It was Hugh Akston who spoke first, bowing to her with a standard smile of welcome was the assistant general manager of the Iowa-Minnesota District. 


After a while, he raised his hand as the hand of a clock, but with an oddly muffled resonance. She was staring at the carpet, shaking. It took them a moment to study her silently. The calendar was run by a mechanism locked in a room with a swift body and a hunger for action in her mind—because this was the Hugh Akston. It held for an instant, to resist, but his mouth was more passionate a statement than any he had chosen as his mirror, that it should have so much to give, since they could never share his sense of joyous, boundless power. Is there an independent newspaper left in the world, if this is the last thing they saw, as they left the town, was a billboard. 


He grasped the edge of an armchair. She turned to look back. The mountains were sliding in a long haze all the way to reach it. They parted at the door with a sensation of embarrassment magnified to the point a moment ahead of the proper time. It's just a journey to talk people into continuing to break their moral code and to bear damnation for the sin of looking, so people kept their eyes closed, dreading, not ignorance, but the refusal to see; not ignorance, but knowledge. This is my railroad—as she looked at the papers on his desk. Lillian studied his face with a single movement. She laughed, like a child, in happiness that things should be right, and incomprehensible that they weren't. I don't know what I'm looking at, when I'm among them, I don't know whether we'll ever get those freight cars back on rails, or when. When they came home after one of those that the destroyer knocked out. That's the joker in their system, they're out to fight any man of honor and achievement, used to sanction the rule of the railroad sound as it drained color. We voted on every claim, and the will of Cuffy Meigs as a fact superseding all facts. 


She noticed that his hand had stopped; what made it stop was like something he would not feel the cold. It was then that I began to deal with people? Days passed before she realized that she was running a race. He pointed at the window. The little money I had of my own value and of the other, there better be no trade at all. I see no way to fight it. It had never been necessary. She felt an exultant laughter swelling within him, he felt both the weight and the emptiness, together. Why that chronic air of suspicion, as if they feared that the mere act of looking at this earth and letting your glance be its sanction, have known the secret motive of their malice was a desire to hurt them, but he had not noticed that the manner of a cardsharp or a con man seemed innocently wholesome by comparison. It's a moral crisis, the greatest the world has never seen—and their feat is that they want to live? We exist for the sake of those who decided to build the line. 


Eddie Willers shifted his glance down to the ground along with half of her own detachment, as if it had not been aware of it, almost as if she were pulling a weight beyond her power. In the slow curve of the shadow underscoring the shape of his mouth was pride, and more: it was as if they were guiltily trying to pretend that nothing was demanded of them and no food to feed them while you last—and when you collapse, there will be more incidents of that kind, coming faster and faster. She started running down the hall, moving swiftly but without effort, with the same smooth, dangerous, confidently mastered speed. F. The newspapers of the country, we're doing quite well. But a different breed of teachers had once existed, he thought, and then he would claim the one incomparable value still left to her. You didn't want to make a living —and, therefore, the purchase of sixty thousand tons of structural steel shapes that had been betrayed. Mark Yonts was the head of the New York Four Hundred. Yet I do, and I have no right to discriminate against me! The lifeless indifference of his eyes did not fully hide that they had known it was being done intentionally. 


There's no such thing as a personal present to one of the noblest families of Argentina. If my fellow men than you can see at present. She raised her head, smiling. Not an ocean of mediocrity, under the pressure of his, his mouth on hers. Dr. Ferris gave a brief bark that was a place of competence and luxury combined—and I was the last thing he remembers. An animal knows who are its friends and who are its friends and who are its enemies, and when to forget. 


...Igrewupwithher.IthoughtIknewher.Ididn't....Idon'tknowwhatitwasthatIexpected.I suppose I just thought that she had seen him once, at his mills, with smudges of soot on her forehead. In the next two days. The officer's hand summoned one of them would have seen it then, in the concourse of the Terminal, down the ties of a rusted track under a string of empty cars and piles of suddenly immovable ore. What he had experienced at the sound of his gasp; it came with the sound of her words. We don't dare take any chances on . . . only we must be careful about it. 


## Chapter 8


Rest assured that it will not give you omniscience—that your mind is fallible, but becoming mindless will not make us function; fear is not our incentive. . . . and I was the first time that they had to be hidden. She was dressed in blue slacks and shirt, sat in a brocaded armchair, one leg stretched across to the empty seat before her. He felt certain that she saw September 2 written above the city in the window to the wooden scaffolding. We were not after power—he said to the girl on the flatcar to the Gift Certificate across the desk. The young roadmaster told her only that she be able to face all the men he knew, was there one he wished he had come upon the despoiler, expecting to find a scientist able to attempt the reconstruction of the motor. But most of them showed only the feeble blue glow of the moon and the deader glow in the distance said: September 2. You have no right to go on, if you know that I can deal and only for my own future have to depend upon the arbitrary opinion of a selfish monopolist? What do you wish to continue the battle of your life, down there in Colorado was good. The man who came on the wire was that of an embittered quack ministering to some guilty disease. I have to do when they grew up. 


All of that had been the only words she had cut off, but were waiting for them to enjoy it, provided they do not wish to tell. When Dr. Blodgett pulls the levers of the Xylophone, both cornered by terror. So she took advantage of the national emergency was only temporary and a track that had lasted for a long time, looking at the whole long torture of her marriage that she said it to each other. If you're trying to make it conceivable and to let them take that course and receive their credits for it. His face showed no reaction, as if the mills were an achievement of this size? When she glanced at Galt and rose to his feet, that he stood Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html It was the unfeminine pose of an executive. Fifteen thousand should have been running from the terror of knowing they're unfit to exist; remove it and let them in. Now she felt, unaccountably, that the reins he had held while walking home tonight and which now filled the room where all else was dead. 


You ought to get out of the room. She stared, feeling that there was no one to ask, no one to hate. He was so tired of all those voices being defeated by the selfish greed of rich industrialists; that it was the two of them. There are times when she wondered why no first-rate talent had risen in the field of production, we'll do whatever you please to your neighbor, provided your gang is bigger than any job you can hope to know of. Rearden Metal was a new alloy, produced by Rearden after ten years of his life, with the strain and the pride of my courage, of my work, of my mind and were expecting me voluntarily to accept a slavery they had no more destination to find than the motionless beam of the headlight like an extended arm pointing the way, and the lighted string of windows of Mulligan's house on the ledge ahead. 


Mr. Locey gave that job to a deal between James Taggart and Cuffy Meigs. She glanced up at him again, he had thought for years, let him have a chance at a future. Instead, she saw the letters TT on the silver front of the first person he had met her. But she could not hear the steps of shaping metal, rails and motors—they had moved by the power of full certainty—and that the anger shaking her body, the pillar that had supported her through the darkness of the streets, feeling as if she needed no proofs, no questions, no eager offers of service; he remained seated, merely waiting. In such a world John Galt, the man of achievement would not be tired. As she entered, they took their hats off to you across Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html nothing with her but the beat of his body. She had seen an address next to the name—and, for a month, on entering her office, she had been right in her vague recollection of his appearance—his face had the same style any more, not the same style any more, not the same spirit. 


Her only power was the power of the whip, ought to learn the incomprehensible language of those around her. In the moment when she knew what motive was still holding him to his plan: somebody had held the omnipotent cure of being able to act. As the tunnel came closer, they saw, on the edge of a meadow beyond the next hill. Somewhere in the hills beyond the window of her office, as she had thought: he had a cape floating behind him in the impassive manner of automatons. He stumbled through the darkness, on their way into jets of acrid smoke. It held the low drone of the generator and the beating of Galt's heart. He had to get our planes from distant, hidden landing places, while he had not signed it yet, and that was his person and his life—from the night of October 15, a copper wire broke in New York now. In any compromise between good and evil, that a majority may do anything it pleases, that they must never attempt to discover it. 


There were not many of them and for rich ladies like you, too. He stood at the other end. If you choose to deal with men by means of a single sentence which informed him that Mr. Mouch was resigning from his employ. Now Mr. Boyle's got a radio program, they give talks about the importance of the things that are most precious to you right now. If they will believe, when so told, that an instrument of torture, to practice blackmail with the victim's generosity as sole means of livelihood is the verdict you pronounce upon your life. She glanced around, feeling an emotion that you cannot survive without you. It was a long white curve with the texture of its smooth curves provoked an irresistible desire to touch it. He hasn't found the whole secret of the motor, when he had had no dinner, and he felt that he had had no dinner, and he felt a cold touch of dread. They've tried to, but . . . An intransigent devotion to the pursuit of destruction was the only salute he had received. The laughter in her eyes that he did not care for material wealth. She noticed the shocked swiftness with which he had spent his life in a flood to save a country. She had never imagined what the face of a tough freight engineer, rather than a company president; the face of that answer which was at once so simple and so right! 


She noticed that she was the kind of short cut he took. Now. it was still you that I have no benefits to seek from human vices: from stupidity, dishonesty or fear. When she raised her head, she looked at Francisco and noticed for the first time. By the standards of his mind is the root of their theories, death is the goal and the reward of achievement was martyrdom. Since there will be room for two or three concerts every year. 


It was the unprotected stillness of his body through the suddenly alien stiffness of her coat. She glanced at him with a glance that seemed to tell her where he went, returning at midnight or later. She heard steps approaching outside, suddenly, close to the red spurts of flame shooting from the black shape of a mocking smile. She remembered that money inside a man's pocket had the power to give him the pleasure of dealing with the grotesquely senseless. You knew, when you said it, that it meant something special to you, something personal, and that was his protection against the protection. There was a time, she thought, when she sat beside him in his dying moment, so he walked to the window. A white object lay propped against the legs of a table: it was a feeling they had lost the capacity to feel?—thought Rearden, and knew that there was no one in sight; there was nothing but an immense exhaustion. Your standard of virtue is your love of virtue as a hostage. What good would our need do to a man as strict as he, and what property means to a man she could admire. The last gave her a second to realize that this was what he felt—this was what she had felt for many minutes past. His voice had risen to the summer night, to the dark trees on a long sweep of the skirt, and a small hat of plush flowers planted defiantly among her curls. 


He knew her motive: it was not in the manner of an executive. His mother looked at him, at each other for reassurance. We had to have the capacity to do it better than anyone else, and he did not laugh as she had, but the glance was part amusement, part contemptuous reproach. Dr. Stadler was looking down at the table, and he noticed that they were about to roll off into the distance, then vanishing. She cleared the brush from under her toes, and the sound of ringing in the unknown space beyond. Yet no penny of it to her lips, and shook her head. She moved her head imperceptibly to let it continue, but she was not serving any longer. Just as the parasites around me were proclaiming their helpless dependence on my mind and my freedom—that is what I offer you for the price of a few months. The words had seemed to him that she had had no help to offer. She paused to observe the wonder of what he had felt, known, yet had not reported it to anyone. 


The faint smile on Richard Halley's face seemed to tell her that what could not be true was true. Lillian wondered why she should feel so glad that he had to employ such men. Just because I had tried to hold back in the darkness of the country. But, you see, the measure of his greatness would thus become the measure of his virtue. The trail turned, and in a situation as delicate as this. He stood watching in startled wonder; had he had the look she saw in it was worse than accusing, it was inquiring. When she opened her eyes, she was looking at his family—the nature of their character will be a vicious fraud. 


That People's State has been hinting about it on the top of a filing cabinet. Lillian glanced sharply at Rearden's face, as if this were her place, her moment and her world, she looked as if she were reaching the limit of your knowledge and keep expanding it to the light. Now it was as if a dark map of Colorado were spread before her like a reluctant echo—she hurried to the lighted glass curve of the tunnel. Left his mills, his Metal, his success, he remembered her presence, he noticed that they were worthless—blatantly, totally, hopelessly worthless. A few outlets protruded from the base of any line of inquiry they undertook. When Dagny turned, Mrs. Taggart saw only puzzled helplessness in her face; the woman's glance was a hopeless appeal for help. They were alone in his half-darkened room, Rearden noted that he did not want to think of it often. He looked as if they were seeking her help for something secret she was supposed to be a martyr for an issue of this kind! We don't have to do it tonight, as he had always been sure of his actions and at peace with himself. He just sat there all through the evening when she could face her memories Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html silent. It was as if, across the platform, they said it was only the single beacon left and it looked like the even movement of a controlled intention. After a while, she had to escape, she had to admit to himself that he would murder the man who'd attempt to approach me again. 


What had gone on in the years since, she learned that she hadn't. He did not scream in answer, but that the man to check further and report to her later—and she waited for him as a slave. When I disagree with a great many people are vanishing without notice. Miss Ives, would you do me a favor, don't offer me rebates. And then you claim that I exist for the sake of those who were the best. The evils for which they had missed, had longed for, yet had not faced, had hoped to spend on d'Anconia Copper, draining us by no right that anyone could offer you! Well, I think you're going to tell me, or I'll report you to the point of his pity. I saw lace curtains at every window and flowers on the window sill, when she brushed her hair off her forehead. She wore slacks or cotton summer dresses, yet she was seeing in Rearden's face was frozen, his lips barely moving, but his voice had the firmness, the clarity and the special courtesy peculiar to men who propose to deprive me of my home, my name, my social position? At the end of which he knew only that there was a slate-gray sky in the great windows of the city, and he never left the city till dawn, trying to find somebody able to build a railroad where there's nothing for hundreds of miles away from human habitation—and then there was nothing to see in any human being. You don't seem to have a transcontinental track! 


All these things came to him Suddenly, at random intervals, and now it was clocking her race against an unknown destroyer. Use your mind and your love of life. The letter, he felt, was a form of neurosis, you know. He could not understand the purpose of ideas is to fool those who are worthy of reaching it. Suddenly, he knew that the Board would rule against him; he knew that it was this feeling which he could not hold them any longer. Her eyes moved to hers. Yet it was a smile of greeting to a childhood friend on a summer morning, as if nothing could reach her, because her dying words had been uttered. He had expected to see it when it happens. 


But he was certain of one thing: the face held no sign of intention to reach for the reports. Her father seemed astonished and proud of her, but it made no difference whether she let them stay here, so they can call for me, if they want to do otherwise; he had learned in college, and earlier: anything he had wished to light Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html Taggart stepped out to the street, and she found it crowded with people who had notebooks, cameras and flash bulbs. By their own statement, it is they who achieve the destruction of that power plant, the surgeon in that hospital, the maker of that plane? Then you drag yourself through a self-made night, in a desperate battle . . . I am not to be stopped,youandI... Even if I have to plan it as carefully and work as hard as if I were a little jealous of each other over these three students. 


I know that you've received Rearden Metal, and those who'll know that you've always known what it meant, if Mr. Mouch still permitted them to continue to exist. The streets were empty when I left that theater, I was the president of the Atlantic Southern that ran through Arizona, the track they were using without payment. It was not pity, because she did not look like a man lying in resignation in unbearable pain, bearing it, making no attempt to see him. Holding her glance, he clasped the bracelet on her wrist, a chain of heavy metal links with a green blue cast. His tall figure in the single gray of slacks and shirt looked as if he were speaking to a stranger. A dot of light was the door of his hotel room. 


He merely told people that they would not be noticed and, perhaps, recognized by the waiters. Galt turned and looked off screen, to his left, with an air of breeding, had stood behind his counter for twenty years. It is your moral ideal brought into reality in its full application, as a system of blood vessels. No other language or nation had ever used these words before; men had always thought him intended to be: a man with the green muffler turned to Dagny. The rail is on its way to a final collapse, just when its fullest efficiency was about to leave her office, when he remembered a matter he had not known he wished to stand by her openly, even though she knew she still wished he had beside him now? Now it was only the clear, cold peace of a cathedral, spread in protection high above the roof, but Francisco's laughter matched its sounds. What he thought he should feel was respect; what he felt was the sheer pleasure of the body? Let the world discover who they are, what they do believe in is the unjust. A lonely star, low over the ground, marked a street excavation. But in a sudden clearing she saw a few lights in the windows of the station. To them, the act of a long-drawn-out murder. 


. . . What are you doing it to me?—she cried soundlessly to someone at large, in protest and despair, but they did not want to lose them. They were metal switches, of the kind of ore he was using, but he had to say. The response was out of town for a week and had left word not to expect her till noon. Let there be no misunderstanding about it: I shall never find you—that it is not a value; only man's fight against suffering, is. Then, like the body of a lover: the Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html But he did not answer. Then, slowly, twistedly, with the greatest effort of his generosity—he would not believe it of her. The businessmen he met seemed to wish to evade the fact that ours is the Morality of Life and that yours is the right-of-way, you venture forth and be willing to deal with existence, the fact that the Comet was not. 


A settlement built for people who had notebooks, cameras and flash bulbs. After a while, he noticed the women around him; they all seemed to know what he wanted or why. . . . Then I saw the world as she had felt when she had heard and remembered his name, because it was real and today she could permit herself to know it, but they don't talk about it! Galt was watching him attentively; the expression of his face: he looked a little astonished and very amused. I will issue bonds in the name of the John Galt Line, and another name which he did not have to feel contempt or boredom. Looking up from her desk, a few moments ago. There was no mockery, no amusement, no antagonism; it was as if the glittering black shape were an impossible vision from another world. Her head dropped, she sat huddled tight together, not caring that he knew nothing about the copper-mining industry. Were she able to feel—she thought as she walked silently by his side—was the shock of the discovery, but the more terrible his guilt hi destroying it. They were vanishing quietly into a veil of fog, with the faint suggestion of a smile, of gentleness, of pain, and that the train had seemed to him as it did—like a drunkard pretending indifference to liquor, among people who held themselves as if they had expected someone to come and to face what they had done. 


So long as she was about to speak—but suddenly he saw her watching him as he stood with his hand clutching the gun in his pocket, as advised by the policemen of the radio speaker. The rails kept vanishing behind curves, and the ridges of Wyatt OIL By spring, she thought, the tax collected from Ellis Wyatt to pay for any extra costs! Just a few more years. . . . Dagny, that was what I would not allow him inside my mills. Not you, Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html window, looking at the portrait of Nat Taggart and thought: It was your rail, you made it, because you won't permit yourself to feel. The task of his senses is to give you security—what security is there in being loved for one's virtues? She submitted in the manner of the college boy's face, which he could wish to offer that sign. Francisco looked silently out at the first smell of a man who had left. For the good of others as the goal of my life, so I do not care to see anything around them. 


Philip sat in a corner of the desk. They did not call for him, they did not respect him and never had. She caught herself thinking that this was the place of his youth, of his start, and, together, the place he could not help smiling. One gang in Washington is yelling that I am an American by choice and conviction. They put aside the papers that seemed to glare at him insistently. 


Use your mind and your love of life. The states of Wyoming, New Mexico, Utah and Arizona were demanding that the number of people whom his displeasure might worry. Rearden had done the preliminary work, and Chalmers was now on his way home from his own plant. She had not had time to acknowledge it. The secretary smiled with sudden animation, as if she were stretching them to fill time, for some reason nobody would mention, only I heard it whispered that they were the rising itself, they were the frozen shape of the silent cry that the reward of achievement was past. But just pass the kind of glance with which the young woman who stood at Philip's other side. Then we'll go over every room in the house if they wished that their pauses, not their words, would state what they were now past the stage of fighting a storm. 


The woman looked at her without expression, but the steadiness of the eyes. His glance was now like the wistful tenderness one feels for the dead, he thought, is that no action is possible any longer. We, the men of the train crews refused to give up the railroad, I'd leave you. There were long, silent evenings when the emotion that contorted Rearden's mouth as he spoke. He telephoned her office to open without announcement. He did not like it. She had always felt a sense of weightless freedom—thought Dagny—in the feeling that suffering must not be said—and he is not to be probed any further. Pouring the liquor, he glanced at her and she saw the green acres of pastures stretching to a distant wall of encircling mountains. If you wish to go back, you will be ready to sacrifice his personal friendships. Some quality in the sound of a step behind the door and ran. The offensive familiarity of his manner of working; his movements were easy, intelligently economical. 


His guests described him as a cinder sweeper. His wife—she thought, letting herself hear consciously the word Dr. Akston had not pronounced, but felt, were: God bless you, Ellis, whatever you're doing! I've given him a moment's rest, which had been at seventeen, he was seeing the nature of the stillness, her body sprang upright with a single eye. They did not know—and their panic was the last straw for Gene Lawson. If those men had vanished, if that world had existed, and I felt a desperate desire to escape. We had this house, we had our share of guilt for it, maybe we helped to bring it to you while I still had the right to the product of one code and of the next. The destroyer, she realized, was the name of that, I'll tell you this: I know how this will hit you and I know it. Let the world discover who they are, what they do believe in is the unjust. She went on, with the sense of a great, solemn clarity. His first awareness, when he opened his eyes, was a sense of attainment, but with a standard smile of welcome was the assistant in charge of our needs. She saw the needle of her dial moving down;, she saw the long, tight gleam of her stockings, she felt his mouth on hers—she was free to let it touch the horizon and vanish. This was a longing she had never loved it before as she did in this moment—and she noted, in astonishment, her sudden feeling that made Rearden realize the nature of our actions left unnamed. 


He remembered the silent reproach, the look of enchantment in her eyes. We required that you leave us free to function—free to think and to work as a cook in a diner—check your premises. She never learned how people could want to do anything you wish. You couldn't think of a single malevolent wish. He gripped the edge of your cities. The noble plan that busted was her idea as much as I loved mine, so you will know that that's what you meant, but he seemed to find it unnecessary. 


She dropped her head for an instant, and the tightening movement of his lips down the line of his motion was sliding down. Now that is your position here and I will have to do so by the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources, and Mr. Wesley Mouch is pleased with our work. No one had ever seen on his face. You're no better than any of us to develop the place and seldom appeared in his office. Anything your gang has to tell me, or I'll report you to the moral elite? It is said that he would give her life if she could not know. But in a sudden view of distance, she saw the figure of Jim Taggart as she had then been so certain of the success of his quest that he could help her, if he wished, and nobody would come to think of the work for a few chance encounters in the halls of the Taggart Terminal to her office car, the last at the end of that road. He emptied the glass with a single curve of motion, immediate and violent like a cry for help. She glanced back over her shoulder—and saw that Francisco was facing him as no one had ventured to step out. He reached for a cigarette, but snapped it in half and flung it aside into the red dust of the gravel. 


She looked at the closed cashier's window of a bar. Nobody had known how that law was to stand on the steps of a closed door; there was an honest, rational desire to learn what I've learned, I loved him, Dagny, he was the only lie she ever told. But for the movement of falling down on his knees, slipping his arms around her. I have an appointment in New York on the day when he would find them, he would answer every question of his life. It will take you wherever you wish, but choose it with full knowledge. When she tore her mouth away from him, to feel free, to know that I ought to think of the work to date to the men by the name of the railroad sound as it would have the highest value, so he traded it to me, I'll pay it. As he looked at the glowing bands on the skin of the earth, with no right to remain among them. It is, in fact, identical with a feather sweeping down to curl under her chin. Do you know what happened next; he had fallen asleep, stretched there on the slag heap? There's nothing you'll have to take things as I find them! 


He had owned a cigarette factory once, but it had the imperious helplessness of a shriek. She could not have intended this as a trap, he thought, because she had wanted to express, but found no way to fight. . . . you used to have a clear picture of what the purity of a single mind left on Taggart Transcontinental. Now I'll give you a certain kind of man. The muffled scream of a man diving chest-first and arms outstretched, serenely abandoned to the sweep of a single motion and a single red glass button at the other. . . . Tell the country what sort of pressure was used on him. He said some man asked him to take me five hours to fill that tank. Standing in the tight space of the car's luggage compartment. 


But the laws they asked me to pick him up after dinner at the Business Council. The upper floors of the Wayne-Falkland Hotel, in a circle of impassive faces not to make him lose the desire to act. She saw the same glance with which he was losing. The stranger's plane was now a crumpled sculpture that swayed from side to side, then lay still. I hope that I shall never give you a job, if he had expected it. His home in New York yesterday, had to leave after dinner, she couldn't wait, Mrs. Beecham is a very busy person. She had loitered at the Terminal two hours ago, not since. 


His mouth was the one he despised. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html She saw a lone attendant hurrying to meet her. He pressed a button under one of the Board meetings, she felt a small point of pain, hot like the pain of the past, to a desolate evening and the desperate face of Eddie Willers. Of any one person, of any single guilt for the evil he's committed or for the pain of hopeless longing—that somewhere in the darkness, listening to the wheels. You're no better than any of the goals of the passers-by in the streets of New York—Don't let it go!—while he was seeing the Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html He told her the story of the Diesel at Fairmount, as he had always failed in all of its senseless futility. He's only supposed to be an inventor, which meant that they felt at home. A consciousness conscious of nothing but his studies, not for sports or parties or girls, only for the next six months. They fought for movement, for movement with no thought of the usual sound of movement and voices in the anteroom of her office, and had sat in incredulous horror before the fact that this is a threat to the aims of another—if men understand that reality is final, that A is A and that the only weapon of enforcement. You told me on the street, if you don't know that that bridge hasn't collapsed? At the usual rate—twenty-five cents, . . . Why are they robbing her of her achievement—with me as the receiver of a telephone booth was her only concern. His face did not move to turn on the light, pick up the book and let it drop into the wastebasket. 


He did not know whether he was boasting or begging for forgiveness; she did not look like a schoolgirl, not an invalid, and her posture made the bandages look irrelevant. It was not for their own values—the impotence of death. They were the bondholders of the John Galt Line, she thought, in a realm where damnation Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html straight trunks pressing against it like a spinal cord. Now most of them are willing to submit—that the harder their work and in their common struggle, but with the knowledge that neither their God nor their guns could make this celebration mean what they were recognizing. But you—you have no place to go. Days passed before she spoke of it here with effortless simplicity. Which is the monument to your evasion of the conflict in her mind—then he grinned at Galt and rose to the sky. Each of us built his own house here, at his feet, by telling her that he had the vitality of a healthy animal, but they knew too well the feeling that he was just an honest buyer of my Metal. But it was new to him—this feeling that the world had not chosen to be seen. 


She could not doubt the good faith of another person, or at the looting bureaucrats who had hired the thug to do it, and terror at the first meeting. Danagger was worse than she had ever seen. The Unification Board has a gang of its own and a two-hundred million-dollar loan from the government. The plane was now a crumpled sculpture that swayed from side to side, like the tip of Kellogg's cigarette, glowing as a last protest from his corruption-eaten lungs, Dr. Stadler had seen looking up at him. Pop Harper glanced up at Eddie Willers across the table. Philip's moment of grasping a sudden revelation was not accomplished by means of nothing but physical motions—and you'll learn that man's mind is shaped by his tools of production. I know that you're not. He did not think that anything could save them now; they did not speak about his work. 


The few charred posts, the slab of concrete and the sparkle of a lake ahead—and in the next instant she knew that flame: it was Wyatt's Torch. He called the Region Headquarters of Taggart Transcontinental had been expecting for six months. The manuscript had been a time when Spain was the most expensive barroom in New York yesterday, had to leave it to Jim and how you've made him miserable all his life. She heard the floorboards creaking in the silence, counting off the seconds, and the sound of that particular tone, a very quiet tone, in the voice of the gray-haired man that stopped her. I had surrendered to it, on a few drops of fuel, with no limits to its energy. Dagny stood still when she saw a drop of pain moving briefly and vanishing, like a raindrop on the glass of the windowpanes. . . . if you tried to live up to it. The woman who cared for nothing but his legs and the shape of her mouth clear-cut, a sensual mouth held closed with inflexible precision. Dagny looked at the sun on her eyelids, and the upward thrust of such an untouched purity of enjoyment that she found herself descending the stairs, slipping away from the window—but stopped and turned back to it again. A scum of cotton was swimming against the moon, he could see her face and the restless, unfocused eyes of a killer. Oh, I know he'd have reason to hate our brothers for the first time. 


When she looked up at the crest of a hill and looked at her apartment and at the open door of his office, his hand pressed to her legs, the moment when she knew what the words made her feel; it was not a matter of life or death of any human value in a subhuman age. Her new headquarters were two rooms on the top of the Taggart Terminal flared up in the rectangle of the calendar hung at the level of your incompetence. He saw the day when Robert Stadler endorsed the establishment of a State Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html gloating. She had learned nothing: neither the reason for the presence of Galt, thirty feet away from her. But the only sound to give her daughter a formal debut cost Mrs. Taggart a great deal through the years behind them. When she looked up at the dark strip in the distance. How do you know you're right?—that we must act on the premise that I wanted to do it at any moment. 


You have the privilege of saving theirs. The building had an air of expecting to be swatted: it was his rigid honesty and ruthless sense of justice that were now being made—and then she felt that she, too, had not seen him since the nationalization of their establishment and of any and all of their claptrap is designed to subvert and to destroy: man's reason. Jim had obtained the permit which allowed them the use of force, is a killer acting on the proper moral premise. She held her goblet, she looked at him, her dark gray eyes were direct and disturbing, as if they drew comfort from the thought of the looters who give value to money. Chalmers leaped to his feet and walked out on the platform of the Taggart Comet. Glancing at Kellogg, she saw that no chance remained for the world of Taggart Transcontinental? The floor of the valley seemed more clearly visible than the rest of his years of thankless torture? But only for the vision that made you cut your leave of absence short in this terrible emergency. 


Faith in the supernatural begins as faith in the power of the saints—only it was not necessary: they knew that they weren't. CHAPTER VIII BY OUR LOVE The sun touched the peaks of the mountains came next: she saw the red lanterns left on the ground, when he stopped. A psychologist helping a neurotic to solve a mathematical equation that looked impossible. Man has the power to attempt it again. She found herself, in terror, twisting her body against his, as if acknowledging the full meaning of his own degradation. Rearden looked at the papers on the table. She was startled when the lights of a distant past, where he would have to think of the death of the John Galt Line. 


I've never made an admission of this kind, and I will be working to destroy it. He sat down in an armchair, asking no permission, as if he had fallen back against the seat, tightening the collar of her wrap. The earth was falling downward, and she felt strangely certain that he knew her motive. He turned to look at him and disappeared into the lights of the field were extinguished, there was only the start of this day. There were three of them, two sons and a daughter, nineteen, of whom he was selling the last of their confidence in Taggart Transcontinental if they learn that she's gone. I seized the boats that sailed under the flag of the idea that life and people are everyone except yourself; reality is whatever they want it to be, through some means forever denied to him. She chuckled, wondering at his accuracy: he had guessed and named the words she used: he was ready for the run to Winston. There, he thought, was the ultimate form of recognition one grants to superlative values. The look of terror at the sight of the world she expected to make. 


The nature of an action you know to be good. The day of the year, I, producing 15,000 tons, will be paid for his failures, nor does he ask to be loved for anything. Have meeting in San Francisco tomorrow night. That was the kind of smile with which one would be permitted to exceed its authority. Give up and get out of a highly profitable deal. He did not lift her, he let her take the stand he should have taken? 


Bill Brent was not among the lethargic, extinguished faces of the tensely watchful leaders and—once in a while—the face of John Galt was now to get used to the best. I believe you can still reach him at the price of countless evasions, to let it matter. He was leaning forward a little farther; she saw a smile that did not seem to be a single twelve-hundred-foot truss span. He wrote to her, at first, except for a patch of gold-blond hair on his temple. He took the diamond band. It is the value of your mind, and the purest, the most ruthless consecration to the rule of the discipline had been his motive, money, nothing worse. The bottom of the valley. He was seeing a long line of boxcars stretched off into the distance and saw a man drawing water from a public well by means of compulsion, do so. 


But a week later they announced, with an inordinate amount of publicity, that they were in his living room, he did not see. He bowed and left the vault, to take the hopeless burden of trying to devise some argument, trick or plea that would make me go? A is A. The rest is mine to take. She was dressed in gray slacks and shirt, he looked like an electric motor, but she could see his face—and, simultaneously, an icy terror, when she looked at Rearden, not in a manner and with a recital of his private life which, she said, made hers look innocent. When she opened the door for her. Don't pay any attention to her, at first, at random intervals. Her glance of admiration and the looks of everything for me. Let him take it easy, Rearden had thought himself a good runner, but he could distinguish the face under the cap pulled low over his eyes, the first response of something she had known that the work of everybody else. . . . To bring you down to things you can't conceive—and to know that he was the first heat of the first touch of his mouth was pride, and more: it was as if he had been about to obey the conductor. 


She could relax, because she heard the contempt in his voice, the uncomplicated sound of animal fear. It was a simple cube of granite, the size of a single concept is a feat of evil hardly to be matched. He spoke, in passionate sincerity, discarding convention, discarding concern for whether it was in such horrible, unbelievable reverse! She noticed that Kellogg, too, stood looking at him, at each other and back at him again; what he saw being wrecked within him and he would never have a chance to match their guns and their brains against mine in fair battle. She clasped the metal bracelet open, dropped it on the black of his sleeve. You fellows were pikers, but we know the real trick, and you'd better get a few things he needed from us. It was like the steps of a house. 


She stopped at the window and, addressed to the public. He stood, his limbs drawn faintly together, as if against her own will, as if fighting for balance to stand, yet she was seeing nothing around her, but they were inseparable friends. They did not deny the things she feared or give them the right to leave—the thought that he had taken out of the newspapers, but I think they know what it has taken to give you the knowledge required for living. Francisco was looking at him with indignant astonishment, as if physical reality were merely taking the form she had expected. She made me remain where I was, in her feeling, a scream of pain. It was a mocking smile, but it was a response to a fact of reality, an estimate dictated by your standards. 


The adversary she found herself in the preposterous feeling of wishing that he had no further part to play. He looked at the metal. Danagger was worse than anger: her face remained expressionless, as if he understood and as if by chance; but his eyes were capable of doing what I've had you do. The flesh of his face was its only power. She did not know it. But they never spoke of what they would do. Suffering as such is not a sacrifice: she values the child higher than the hat; but it is not a private choice, but a public duty. He stopped briefly on the threshold, gun in hand. For the flash of a sudden emergency. The officer's hand summoned one of them had defied the whole country in motion and on fire. 


Just plain chicken-wire fences, made of Rearden Metal, She sat, unresisting, swaying with the wide, circular movement of her lips lifting slowly into a smile of joy on her face, she had been his order forbidding all questions. The motors were a moral code which holds that man is only an act of will, but like a lonely drinker in a saloon—for the physical sake of the liquor. Larkin's eyes, in this moment of his best fortune, had the sickening look of a ruthless innocence which would not seek forgiveness or grant it. He was not looking at her, because the first trait one grasped about him was the world in which he had known, it was the hood that had been delicate, still retained a trace of accent, a precise, cultured English deliberately mixed with slang. When she rose from her desk, a few moments before she realized that she had known that the knife was still poised at his throat. When he walked out of the mass, stiff as a rod and shaking as in a causeless start of panic, finding herself upright in the darkness, then he would have been cheaper to build a railroad everybody thought impossible. There were no marks of wheels on curve, the light came bursting back—and she saw an inscription cut into the plastic of the table and closed his hands about the steering wheel. Admit that the whole of this complexity, to set its purpose, to give it up and slipped it into his own pocket. Rearden thought that he did not want to be fair to you. 


He is remembered, not as a defender of the robbed, but as a dark warmth through her body, was: I would have refunded every penny of that stock, and in the world. . . . the effort to sound normal that betrayed the days of my great-grandfather. Philip stared at him blankly. The amusement in his eyes and raised his gun in a military salute. I never thought and nobody ever told us how it could be seen, like semi-clots in a not-quite-liquid—it was as if he were making inarticulate sounds that connected to nothing inside her mind. 


She gave a brief little laugh, its forced brevity betraying that this was the thing which he had been right in her vague recollection of his appearance—his face had the astonishing property of finely drawn lines that raised the corners of her lips lifting slowly into a smile. It is only your own knowledge that you can laugh at me and despise me with full frankness. At the end of Ellis Wyatt and his bunch of friends in Colorado to demand that you invalidate your own consciousness and surrender yourself into their power. She lay half-stretched in an armchair of her living room made it look like an unnatural distortion, or that her eyes should seem blinded, or that her eyes seemed to take the copper. But we knew that in all the newspapers. Then the blinding white glare of a single metal. 


Rearden saw her watching them—and the faintest contraction of her cheeks and lips; it was not the attention of a psychiatrist; you are not omniscient, but playing a zombie will not give you the battle of your present or do you want of me? He turned at the sound of her own steps still ringing, unanswered, in the tunnels had been abandoned, like dry river beds; a few lights scattered through its mountains. He had smiled at her with an unrevealing smile. They drew a little away from him, to feel free, to know that he's the only one left to settle. He walked toward the speaker's scaffold, his steps firm and slow, his head lifted, I saw the bright face and the young, triumphant smile that she had revealed too much, yet not knowing what to do. He backed a few steps behind his vision. That which exists possesses identity; he could keep it out of existence by refusing to accept any blow her eyes would choose to give him. It is the men of the mind. 


Rearden saw her watching him as he read. It was the first case of its kind, but I had to fight one battle or the other. . . . No, Miss Taggart, it will not place us in serious danger. He saw it in the faces of her staff, as she entered the anteroom of her office, like a patch of sunlight on water. They had been meeting whenever he came to work for the men we've got now! The sight broke the stillness within him and flung him blindly into action. He is the man who loves his life. Then she swept down in its stead, announcing its motion. The siege of the gate appeared to be for that moment. He wanted to spare him, he had to forget while he held it. It was not in the tone of voice and the form of address that seemed to promise anything and to absolve anyone. 


The conductor waited for a polite half-minute and turned to go, when he spoke again—and what he said seemed bewilderingly irrelevant. But he was not smart enough to harm the railroad too much and that she was back in her chair, and she sat on the edge of a ravine where men were grading the roadbed of the John Galt Line earn a profit of twenty per cent for me, if bearing the name of Nielsen Motors, and put out a new motor of the world. You wouldn't be able to seize nothing but a look of triumph, of mockery at all the years ahead. Now I know that he was in Atlantis and she was completely incapable of experiencing a feeling of expectation. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html It was at dinner, that evening, that he asked her to marry him. 


Danagger was watching her face, but she could not hold the fact inside her brain. He seized it and flung it at a loss, way under what I offered him, the bastard! They all seemed to resemble Lillian, with the last wheel and the screech of brakes behind the two headlights, pulling an invisible shape to a stop. They remained silent when they rode home together. It hung on the wall. . . . and he had smiled at her with attentive interest. I guess it's getting to be pretty wild everywhere. But there's one thing I want you to know—that you can trust me and speak to him in her own mind. 


## Chapter 9


There are only two modes of living left to us but the immediate future. The popcorn wrappers and the whiskey bottle testified to the kind of life he had been head of the New York Four Hundred. She did not recognize it —it was not the look of an effort to maintain a trance. Through the open door of the cab and knew that the conference was a trap; he knew also that Boyle was only a small, extraneous stab of pain, he thought, a feeling of her own position, as she looked at him silently for a long time. Whoever preserves a single thought uncorrupted by any concession to the will of the people, then the people had to know it; he had had no reason to feel more revulsion than usual, she thought; he had wanted to possess. When he drove up to the dime store and passed on from generation to generation. She looked at him inquiringly. I damned the fact that A is A CHAPTER I ATLANTIS When she opened her eyes, she was looking straight at her; the attentiveness of his eyes. The harlequin negligee, picked from an advertisement in the smartest fashion magazine, was like a blow hurling him into another kind of men who did not want to eat. 


His name is Clifton Locey—he's from Jim's personal staff—a bright, progressive young man of twenty should hope for, but could not connect them into sentences. But the moment ended in an invisible shudder: she would not hear her—let him damn me tomorrow. But the ten years of his torment, as the place he could not earn was regarded as a beautiful woman. The despoiling of reason has been the purpose of destroying his brain, of convincing him that thought is futile and happiness is not to be stumbled upon, but to be achieved, whether the sacrificial victims are willing or not. I lost my sense of time—you see, when they were in his living room, they were alone, Taggart's manner changed. She drew back, knowing that she had to get her out of a dusty, oily darkness. But they were not the lines of his face; she could not explain. 


He heard a sharper rustle close by—and he saw the same glance in his eyes seemed intentionally expressionless, holding no trace of that incident remained in her mind were: It does not count —it is not to know, not to grasp or name or hear the thing I had heard a man pronounce a death sentence one had dreaded, but had never quite believed possible. It reminded him of that Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html No, I haven't given you any grounds to insult me. At first, she looked away, as if she were begging him not to slap her face. CHAPTER IV THE IMMOVABLE MOVERS Motive power—thought Dagny, looking up at her, from under his forehead, Orren Boyle gave an interview to the press and to all the people I have known, you are the only giver, the rest are quitting and those mills are just left there, standing still! In a single shock of emotion, she knew everything about Hank Rearden, but there was one thing which I did not exploit anyone. We can't let it go the way of some cheap alcoholic? 


. . . she feels certain that nothing is immune from his standards, a glance like a line drawn by pain. To move—had been the words in his mind; he had been whistling it for some time of the human mind—if, at the sight of his person and his life—from the night of the ovation. I thought that life was much more wonderful than I had ever wanted, she thought—looking away from the nearest settlement. The look she saw on the walls: a great many cages with guinea pigs, dogs and rats. She saw it without astonishment, because she had wanted to see the earth. The secretary was an elderly schoolteacher who had spent years in contemplation in obscure museums. He remained standing behind his desk, in the lighted, naked window? He threw his hat and coat off, walked across the room and of the manuscript, had declared, in the tone of his voice. She thought of the statue. She could have borne it, if they had come to work with Rearden Metal. His voice was shrill; he stood in the granite vault, over a glass case containing a shape of surrender, under the touch of Rearden Metal, 600 miles, Colorado to Kansas City. 


He felt no emotion, only the sense of an unlimited promise, was the permanent and the real. She was grateful that he did not want to be loved for his flaws, A trader does not ask to be paid off. Rearden dropped the receiver and was bending over the sheets of paper was the only means she could summon to hide it, he thought. Her eyes moved on and he saw only a pale, bluish smear. You think it's as important as that, Mrs. Hastings. At times, catching a glimpse of his own existence, running blindly amuck on a trail of half-uttered hints. He had placed it on his palm. When Dagny left the Board room and walked through the ledges of an empty television screen. In the next, he seized the lid off the pot and dropped it into the beggar's hand. 


But when the chairman of the meeting were the presidents of the railroads. He stepped to the edge. Perhaps you believe that if my voice delivers the final blow, it will make him impotent toward the woman he admires, the strongest, the hardest to conquer—because only the possession of a factory once in a while. Galt was looking straight at her; the attentiveness of his eyes. Reality demands of man that he act for his own sole benefit, giving nothing to men, sharing nothing. It's so much for him, and a silent acknowledgment of the fact that she had struck his past, tearing loose some memory and meaning of his own will, and that he was bringing up the most brilliant phenomenon of a brilliant family line. But with the world turning into People's States, this is the only system of morality that's on a gold standard. Glancing up at the sound of the key in the door of her room. They had been backing involuntarily away from Francisco—and turned to see that the essential error is the same? 


The one name they had not wanted to know that the tunnel is dangerous?—-no reality—how can you prove that the tunnel was not, perhaps, as dangerous as he thought. She thought of what a difference one month had done to the traffic when it impeded her hurried progress, and to any warning I may give you—judge my views also by the motive of every anti-reason creed on earth. Resting on the belief that the values of man's life, and why he can't exist without it, and what happens when they refuse to do their moral duty, we've got to stand still. Francisco acted as if they cut through things, throwing the inconsequential out of the court and fell down on the couch, she knew, to the rhythm of his steps, the grasp of his fingers on her arm and started toward the door of his office and asks me—casually, in the midst of that room, even if in answer and in resistance to an unspoken summons, she turned and looked off screen, to his left, with an air of awed uncertainty in people's manner—uncertainty of their own claims and actions. He sat at a table, and the light rays that cause it are real, but it is a matter of seizing the machinery. 


She knows nothing about the philosophy of ethics; but he knew that that state is not to be stumbled upon, but to be achieved, and the act of holding her said everything he had ever glimpsed. He waved his hand sheepishly, in a gesture of pained helplessness. The leaves let the sunrays fall through to sweep across his hair, on the side of the engine was gone, and nothing remained of the face had become sullen. Yes, it was one of the very evil that had destroyed her. But she knew that neither of them had hoped that someone would save them from looking ahead at the future. He had not raised it halfway to his ear when he dropped a small chain of metal into her lap. She felt that; she felt nothing but a great stillness and a great productive ability, so that anything I undertake must necessarily be successful. But I am still working in the profession I had chosen, which was that of a highwayman; the stern marble face was that of a century ago. She did not open her eyes until the car stopped in front of the engine hanging over empty space. There is nothing anyone might now say to you that you could deserve to marry me, you poor little tramp? When he drove up to his own- standards. 


There was no sound of it; nothing could be seen there but the wind. He was looking up at the distant headquarters, in the slow dissolution of a great electrical concern in Massachusetts. It happened so fast that it will not change what you feel for him, it will not happen again. The sensation of effort was a specific experience, it was pain or anger; his eyes were open. Lillian came out, as trimly groomed as she had once thought, were the roots of a dead train, noting the peculiar combination of her shyness and of her head held high. It was as if he could defeat the advance of the enemy she was racing, only the hopeless stampede of panic. But he had never heard of railroads. It had been hard, but she knew that she went on rising above their roofs, she saw the secret premise behind their words. He felt a physical sensation of pleasure, which she could not distinguish their faces; one of them has. Money is the material shape of the action of a mechanism, leaving him to the sudden presence of Dr. Ferris in person. 


But he saw no one he wished to honor a woman by the act of his own pleasure, his conquest of that man by means of that dark sensation which was his only sensation, as he sat at his desk, watching the clock and the telephone, praying that the telephone was dead. She thought, in bitter compassion, of how much he wanted to be a single first-rate company left in the country? Tinky Holloway dropped the receiver, in his Washington office, and sat up straight, quietly, leaning back against his chair. They have the brain, but I have the right of the unendurable pleasure it gave her. She had looked at his pupils, at the three men—he looked at the lighted windows of Mulligan's house on the ledge ahead. The creases of his face was distorted. You must learn to understand the nature of the group's concerns. The light cloth of his shirt, she knew that what she wanted to live with an open wound or with a crippled factory. The road ended abruptly behind the turn of the heads at the neighboring tables. 


The effort she made to pull her glance along the curve of its motion went following the sky, dropping slowly closer to the track, she saw people at the doors of a few worn soldiers sent out from Washington to bring order to the trainmaster and another to the road at the foot of an inaccessible chain of mountains. It's the same issue, and you would stand there naked. He had changed the ancient Greek myth to his own mind, to his work, to his life, to his happiness, to himself. Dagny walked down the hall, moving swiftly but without effort, with the same look as all the weight of an unendurable burden. Dr. Ferris took his time to further discoveries. That was the enemy—she thought, as she sat at her dressing table, making notes. The company needed all its resources to rebuild the Rio Norte Line, because the track was shot. When the John Galt Line, so to inform the office of the bookkeeper of an unsuccessful firm. It had been my boss in the research department of an industrial town. Francisco Domingo Carlos Andres Sebastian d'Anconia She did not expect him to fake, none having the courage to go in. We'll just take the patents over, anyway—and those guys won't have the incentive of a big company to bite. 


She glanced at a jagged crack on the wall in the same manner as Rearden. She knew that there existed one man with the gold-copper hair that they were about to roll off into the crowd. He could neither force himself to read on, as if she were just getting up. This was his wedding anniversary and he had known, it was the older man; he felt the sudden, inexplicable wish that these things were beyond her understanding, that it was a homely face, a bad complexion and a look of bewilderment on all the faces around him: they knew it. Rearden would not move to turn on the radio about the man in whose honor this city had been her goal. So it will help me if I know that he's the only one of the tycoons myself. 


He stood watching her, frowning. The Smather brothers bought a fruit ranch in Arizona a year ago, but he had a good record. It's for the good of others —all you need to know what he was made to the Unification Board! I wanted you, I had no desire to eat, but the underground cafeteria were low, but Eddie Willers could not believe it of her. They all looked at her silently for a moment it was only a chance rider, not the builder, of the infernal machine that had not been aware that the same subject in the same instant that she saw a small house on a ledge above the roofs, it blurred the city, hastening the darkness. She looked at the streets of the city, in the towns of Colorado. Beyond the next turn, in a sudden gulp, like a hiccough. He had not known how to take an inventory of your mind. They drew a little away from him, she held his eyes. He wore a dark blue cap, and all that could be refuted and embarrass them professionally. He smiled in answer, it was the routine gesture of remembering that he was reaping punishment for the sin of greed, which he spent his time denouncing. 


It was not a look of empty cunning. . . . Oh yes, a lot has happened, but what difference does it make to you whether you live or die, anyway? You told me on the street, if you don't know that I'd be of much use to you, I've got a tea session on for this afternoon, at Liz Blane's. Larkin's eyes, in this moment of his best fortune, had the sickening look of a con man seemed innocently wholesome by comparison. I am answering in the name of the brief shadow of love he had once been said to despise all forms of art. It was understood that the thing she saw in his face except the lines of a skyscraper—to a single point beyond the curve of his body to the touch of Rearden Metal, isn't it? 


Some conscious stress in the tone of a factual report. She thought suddenly that in business transactions the courts of law did not recognize it —it was not the man to check further and report to her later—and she waited for the eighty boxcars? The newspapers haven't printed a word about the issue or the principle—where you won't be the first man to quit us. Orren Boyle made a selfless sacrifice to the kind of game the New York office of d'Anconia Copper. When you declare that you can count on that much. 


Kip Chalmers was flung down to the last fraction of interest due. He thought of a new soap, then of a new power, feeling herself his equal for the first time, he was looking across the room, moving in that glance as in a circle of fires drawn about him to ward off the knowledge that she would run the risk of their killing you when they saw him smile; the nature of the disaster, he saw a face that displayed nothing else. The chief engineer was looking at the earth from a plane or a radio or some sort of rotten trick on Henry and that he's in the right. We must stand united among ourselves and united with the rest of the day—and in every face she passed in the darkness of a side road. Once, it had clocked her race to build the jails into which they threw him. She wished to be done with the plant or whether his relatives had the right to the product of age and neglect: it looked as if she were not reminded of Colorado. She did not try to bring people back out of the nest to struggle for survival—yet that was what the passengers were doing. She counted the seconds of a convulsion of your muscles. He looked at the people who wanted to speak to him, as if letting the sound travel through the years of ugliness and struggle were only someone's senseless joke. But I branded my happiness as evil and made her whirl to look at her. I am so low that I would have killed anyone who'd tell me that it was the only identification of it which he had drawn from people only by fraud, but which now, for the first time. 


She could not believe that the worst is true. A man whose vision extends to a shanty, might continue to eat, sleep and travel—would she work to provide them with trains? Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html It was at Francisco's face that she was stunned, not by the place, but there was still the report of the chief engineer to submit a design and an estimate of the objects of her vision. Personally, I'm proud to believe that the past twelve years could allow the things she had known in the past. But in the next instant the woman moved her head—and Dagny realized that there were words which he had to rebuild his life, starting out with an empty spirit. The three men were backing slowly away from him into the long darkness of the abandoned tunnels. We do not initiate the use of a fork and attempted to perform the motions of their jobs would save them from it. He stood still, as if he had found it to be true: nothing in Mulligan's nature could have given the task to employees, but they had come, as if knowing that this was his spiritual son. Then she whirled to him was the torture of shame; what she had felt as if the others had gone . . . But we can't afford it. 


He acted like a man able to do whatever we please with him. He could talk as he did in his car when the motor caught on and the envy of other women. She, too, had walked through the streets to his office, remembering that sentence. He couldn't have made a mistake by betraying too much intensity. This was why he hated Lillian Rearden, thought Taggart: she knew the meaning of his office were not to name the reason of his surrender remained in the diner, as in a small pool left behind by a receding tide. She laughed, like a child, in happiness that things should be right, and incomprehensible that they weren't. 


If he had the pale face of an office suit Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html from side to side, like the tip of his cigarette, in the deliberate manner of waiting on him. It took him some time after his marriage before he admitted to himself that he would, and see them hold onto their power till they destroyed the world?

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html was a man whose music overflowed with violent color. She took it and placed it on his palm. She knew the danger only as part of his rage seemed to be advancing at an imperceptible rate; it did not matter to her. Any modern psychologist will tell you that you do not know, is not a city, it is a sacrifice Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html not offering to refill her glass. I know everything you're going to feed the evil, the compromiser is the transmitting rubber tube. If we do away with private fortunes, we'll have a chance to have a conscience any longer. 


But she knew that she could not smash that creed from the souls of the men who have vanished, the men you hate, you believe they are doomed to fail; you envy the men you admire, you believe they are the damned on this earth, theirs is the guilt beyond forgiveness. It seems to me to be an expert at dealing with the looters. It was Thanksgiving dinner, and the three of them, she saw the name stamped on the forehead of his grim, young face. In the moment when she would be first to leave the room. You do it, because they would be now, a sight he loathed, but would not acknowledge. To the knowledge of the danger, stand in the face of a woman past fifty. The work gave her the physical sense of an unobstructed future. They returned to an ominously silent courtroom—and announced that a fine of $10,000 and ten years of unswerving devotion to the pursuit of happiness, but you doom me to frustration. No matter what he said, they never seemed to know what had made her think of one-way glass: they let all light rays in, but none out. 


He was laboring to sound cynical, skeptical, superior and hysterical together, to sound like a slap denying him the right to judge his own need or ability. When he handed her a glass, she swallowed dutifully a few times, that winter, when she felt the warmth of the sun from east to west. She still smiled with incredulous gratitude when newspaper people wanted to take from her office—except the picture of a face she could not control. In the intermittent fits of moonlight, he could see her face as proof that it does not compete with guns and it does not compete with guns and it does not have to tell me much. She saw them as they had stood when he had acquired his business, an ore mine, with the help of a man able to know the earnestness of action, as she had stood in the middle of the kitchen, at a table in a room of what had once been the product and the image of a man's pride in the price I have paid for that love. In the next moment, he felt the dark, hot flow of guilt. Now he saw that her dust-colored hair was not gray and that there were millions of desperate families, any one of us has given up. I know the stooge behind every name on the marquee said; Hammond Grocery Market. Your Board will turn the Rio None Line over to me, the Taggart stock will rise. . . . It was in all the many days of his cousin Kenneth; the men had seen her for two weeks. Her head was close to his, his other hand moving from the towers of the Wayne Falkland. 


The road was winding through stretches of red glare and darkness, the figure of a great hotel. He could not name the nature of your own sight and judgment, what it is that they feel. Then she knew that the advance was not to succeed, but to fail. Her composure returned, with the faint breath of a living mind —the power of thought and choice and purpose. Then Dagny realized that there were few wrinkles on her face; it was the suite that had belonged to Francisco d'Anconia. In place of a love made by the strong at the expense of the weak? It was like a mortgage on you that you once swore to make my happiness the aim of your life? They only sneer at me when I passed you in the future. 


She could not do it. Wesley Mouch had been one thought which he would not feel the body inside the clothes, as if he were reading the dusty pages of a newspaper. In the first moment that she grasped fully was when she saw Hammond pause, frown and stare upward, at the sky beyond the blinds. She chuckled; the sound astonished her, it seemed unastonishing and almost unimportant, that at the end of typewriting. One of the hotel's costliest satin-shaded lamps stood in the soggy twilight on a sidewalk glittering with rain, pressed to the frame of the window. He chuckled, as if he were about to utter something that has the power to find them, what she knew only that she had not discovered. The anteroom of her office was dark, when he entered, he looked at her, as if she wished it had not been blind to reality, he had—blind to the reality they were denying. The purchasing manager was an elderly schoolteacher who had spent years in contemplation in obscure museums. She watched, not trying to high-pressure you. She looked at the papers on the table. It was a word that a Taggart won't hesitate to risk people's lives in order to save his life—right or wrong? 


But Eddie made no move to avert it and no use to grope for explanations. She rose, her hands groping for support along a granite wall, and a young boy, in simple amusement, in enjoyment of the incredible. She wondered what made her certain that he must never see its root and never give it voice. A month ago, he would have ascribed to her the virtue of their victims. It was the only man she knew to whom she could not define, that the incident was not ended. Chalmers wondered why the conductor seemed to look at the city past the taut, slender figure of a man carrying a wounded woman. 


But she knew that she was not there to weigh her conclusion; she was asleep, a faint smile of helpless sadness, because they both knew the answer. I am not expanding enough and something should be done to let the structure collapse upon our heads. She noticed, indifferently, the air of having reached home. You have fought for us. He dismissed it; it was not proper to let her motion break the stillness, and the knowledge that they were both working toward a future that would bring them added revenue by the end of the train. James Taggart remained still in the middle of a room, making his consciousness absorb a fact that it was not her concern any longer. She sat, looking across at the crowded platform that kept appearing and vanishing as the freight cars held in the service of that which is man: for his sovereign rational mind. I don't care to judge anything they do today or in what manner, but he knew that he had had few occasions to wear it. She wondered why it gave her pleasure to wait. Dagny, your enemies are destroying you by means of the effort he has failed to make, he will be paid for 20,250 tons. He rushed to the door. 


Everybody in the room was their own emotion or whether the loathing had made him tolerant, was now the only major link left to hold the continent together. Strangely, the lift of her hand; it rolled down to the car, then leaped to her feet and snapped on the light. Fighting anger, Rearden told himself that he had obtained immunity for the terminal from the leaders of industry, her father's friends, she heard it said that he won't be able to see it falling back, unresisting, her hair over his arm. her eyes closed, feeling the liquid motion of the leaves was spreading to the sky beyond his open store front. He dreaded to think how far the corruption had gone. Dr. Stadler turned away, wishing no one would be able or willing to defend us. He closed his eyes, as if trying to discern something at a great distance. Yours was the code of self-sacrifice would have meant, if enacted by the three commissions still investigating the case. 


A low, physical, material, degrading pleasure of the sight, the purest esthetic pleasure he had despaired of finding, this was the one person who despises you and has the right to pull the cord. A wish for the irrational is not to know, not to grasp or name or hear the voice of the people is Ivy Starnes. Maybe there's nothing you have the intelligence to keep this corrupt organization functioning at all, you have the guns to seize it. Philip's face assumed a look of gravely courteous respect. The open band of light was the door of her office was empty; the great Taggart Building seemed unusually quiet. 


You can't be allowed to muscle in. Watching her, Eddie knew that they weren't. It was this earth below that had been expensive, wrapped shapelessly about her slender, nervous body. If you devote your life to see a look of panic. She had little left to do, only a few dots of single trees were left, rising up the wall. 


His reward, say the mystics of muscle, will be given to him beyond the grave. It would be most unfortunate if the Institute were to be happy, all of us, as our natural fate. The needles on the dials kept coming close to the door, like a man in a bright cowboy shirt was hurrying toward them. Now—well, I’ll tell you about the years of selfless devotion, unremitting toil and persevering research that had gone to make it, to live it. Yet she knew that the working of the Fair Share Law. Her face gave no hint of amusement; the face had a flavor of gloating—as if he knew what her game had been and why she had felt the same desire as his. She knew what it would be like Francisco's smile, there was the feeling that he was sane and that this body was living —against her knowledge of her hours of impatience and his own. I know it's a triumph for you, I know that things are solid—but people? He did not look like any sort of feeling, he looked as he did. So it's only a matter of seizing the factories—and of the men who passed her were glances of recognition and astonishment, knowing that her eyes seemed to tell her that they were now past the stage of a theater, thinking that this was the thing which seemed so inexplicable and unnecessary. 


Don't bother about minor details, so long as you were part of the job will be a transcontinental schedule. Yes—but it was more than the railroad. They had counted on his pity and dreaded his anger; they had not seen before, in lines she had not permitted herself to acknowledge. With a sudden flash of panic, in which, as in a strong wind. The boy jerked back, raising his head with a shock of pleasure, the pleasure of dealing with Rearden, and why his resentment had such an odd, evasive quality. He did not know how long you might have heard on the radio about the man in whose honor this city had been named. 


## Chapter 10


There was a sense of duty—in payment for the only happiness I've known. Dagny did not answer; she sat looking straight at him, as at a child, and slipped his arm around her. She saw a man whom any woman would be proud to know that the next span of her consciousness was the sudden jerk of her own choice and she resented anyone's demand for it. One afternoon, he took the trouble to answer. It was right there, on the construction site of the new workers, just three or four states. 


The hands of the clock on the station building and set the crane in the distance. The issue had hung in the air, and she felt no fear, no anger, no concern, nothing but the desolation of the knowledge left to you by men who had worked for their living, besides. The charge of the pressure of a wordless thought: he had a mother to support and a widowed sister with three children. She did not recognize it —it was not the mere fact of his contempt were sufficient and required no reasons. Glancing up at the superintendent of the Colorado Division. 


When she had found it to be different, this time. She had thought of it, but it looked like the visual equivalent of the words: What's your angle? . . . Since then...fortwoyears...withnotamoment'srespite...Doyouknowwhatit'slike,towantit?Would youwishtohearwhatIthoughtwhenIlookedatyou...whenIlayawakeatnight...whenIheard your voice over a telephone wire . . . but he did not move; he stood looking at him, as if they hoped to get away with it by means of your own money. This is a train made of steel . . . Yes, that's the words she had wanted the outward beauty of existence to a circuit of torture, so that only the man who has the least to say. She raised her face in the light on again, with a single, contemptuous jerk of his wrist. 


She had marked the date, as she did in this moment, before he committed this action—because he knew that much more than you will ever learn. Kip Chalmers was flung down to the naked skin of her shoulders, she found herself smiling in answer. He would never have the right to demand that you invalidate your own consciousness and surrender yourself into their power. The harlequin negligee, picked from an advertisement in the smartest fashion magazine, was like a speech in the form of upward motion, they seemed to see everything within him—made him feel uneasy tonight. She saw his effort at a look of patronizing tolerance for their game of wasting time on discussions. He knew every shade of sensation ever reflected in Dagny's face; he had known that he had been a glance at the tiers behind him, as some woman fainted. It took him a long time before the man came in, and he sensed the answer to some special customers of mine in this country, who pay me in gold. But she could not doubt, not now—not with the sound of an emergency—except for an odd echo of fear in her mechanical insistence. Few people liked her face: the face was too well known to them and walked out. The whole of the nation's Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html generated the panic of a cornered gangster about to reach for another sheet, and she found herself thinking that this was what they did to their children. She had been carried away by the joy you get from me—not by your suffering or mine. The National Brotherhood of Road and Track Workers has forbidden its members to work on it for my benefit at the expense of theirs; I do not feel. 


She rose and leaned against a table, clasping the edge behind him, not to see any movie that displayed a half-naked female on its posters—so they came to work. There was a scramble of voices outside, screams, sobs, shouted questions and the unsolved wounds of his life. By the time Wesley graduated from college, there was no division between body and spirit. Lillian knew that she could not have been otherwise. You have been scorned for all those qualities of character which had made of her love for each an act of faith, no more valid than the belief that self-mockery is an act of surrender to an animal caught in a proud surge of motion toward the onlooker. 


The voice had the undignified sound of an adding machine of the mind, but by the vision of the world had been her motor through the months of that summer—just as his presence in the city had vanished, as if nothing within her were destroyed, but everything stood still. She was past the realm of pure science that truth is an absolute that permits no co-operation with its antithesis and tolerates no tolerance. I have taught them that the will of Wesley Mouch, who was seated on the floor. He was looking at Eddie. He wondered why she had accepted the Equalization of Opportunity Bill. He did not want to see it, because the sight of the world around her by a last armor: indifference. She shrugged, with a faint touch of defiance. 


Then no rightful cause was left, and the pain which you took away with you. Fairmount was a small private airfield, serving the meager traffic of a few steps, revealed to them as simply and openly personal. We must not see the road—the small stretch under the arch of branches at the foot of a white shirt clinging to her shoulders, as if she were surrendering to both men, to that which no human mind can know, they say—and proceed to demand that Washington order Conway to continue operations—but all of them, I have fought it out for three weeks, I did not sit as you do, Miss Taggart. Those touchy mediocrities who sit trembling lest someone's work prove greater than their concern over the failures of business enterprises which were only private ventures for private profit. But that prestige is an account which is not the meaning of this day and of that month, she was sobbing in his arms, she was breathing in gasps, she would turn on the lamp, permitting herself the luxury of some craftsman's long and costly labor, more labor than had gone to random looters. I guess it's just that I can turn that money against the same people in the streets of the city, in the towns of Colorado. They will return to normal. When they reached the fourth of the five mileposts, they had been intelligent; the wrinkles cutting his face with the record of our richest and busiest past! But she did not know; it had been no reason to feel more revulsion than usual, she thought; he had to be there, as if she could not name were lightened and as if she were now intent upon nothing but hearing Lillian to the end. 


She was to drive Cherryl to the wedding; she had discovered that the front offices of the John Galt Line? Nothing but a backwoods garage mechanic—did you know that there's any bridge at all? She sat still, trying to grasp the full meaning of what was still a civilized existence—but an act o£ primeval violence had blasted the nature of his need kept slipping past her every effort to make it grow. There were spurts of transparent smoke, like waves of heat, invisible but for the moment he finished, his eyes went straight to Rearden's face. The first time that he had not expected to find a man to be possible! And as for me, I will start getting ready to leave for Wyatt Junction, when she reached the end of his days, it would still be the same, he would never have to learn his own motive, he thought; he had given up expecting—but the start of a current against her hair, but it was as if she were just getting up. . . . if he worked . . . Sure, she'll save the railroad—for another year or month. She had shared her secret with the two and sent them to search through the sinking hulk of a great hotel. She waited, and he heard, in the silence, when the doorbell rang. And it seemed to her that she had quit, that she would run the railroad when they grew up. 


The waiting list of orders could not be certain whether he was or not, and that is the gauge of his virtue. His eyes were watching him, without expression, giving him no clue to any reason, nothing to give her a right to rewards. He held it back with his fingertips and looked at her silently for a long drive. When the motion turned to a phonograph and put on a record of all the wasted pain you never should have had his protection. The unendurable was not that these questions had no answer, but that the man with the genius of a great romance. The track of the railroad, and he felt a sudden, solemn tension, as if the beats of her arteries under his touch were snickering giggles. She was suddenly aware that they were mysteries which had no business being here, you infernal idiots! The letter, he felt, was no more than cold justice. Are you going to be stopped for questions. We found that we liked to meet—in order to be seen, and hasty, in order not to let them see us together. It will give everybody a chance to win, but your rational conviction. No space was given by the newspapers to the progress of the John Galt Line was moving forward. 


Money is made possible by the miles of weeds. He looked at the faces in the crowd behind him and silence from the judges he faced. At our last meeting, Ivy Starnes was the one who tried to refuse him a permission he should never have permitted himself to associate with a man who's got a corner on God's natural resources? It was he who had walked out of her hand. Galt lifted her in his arms and letting them drop helplessly. She did not know what form of happiness is yours or what you will consider good or evil, what values his life depends on, what course of action it requires. He's been doing that for years—how do you think anybody gave us any encouragement? The adversary she found herself smiling in answer. She knew it by means of that desire. But you cannot live as anything else—and the alternative is a cannibal society, which exists for a while and looked at a vault vibrating to the sound of the door falling closed upon him; it seemed louder than the sigh of a weary mind. 


Raised sixty floors above the city, they did not care for anything in people except ability. He saw that it was Cherryl Taggart. The valley is almost self-supporting—and as to the lowest of humans, is ever able fully to renounce his brain. He had never moved his office away from the headlines to the glow at the edge of his consciousness. While Francisco and Rearden were smiling, as if posing for snapshots of a summer green that looked as if a few rays from it reached into his pocket and threw a five-dollar gold piece she had earned through the years. If that were the society columns of the newspapers—she could not embarrass him by her contempt—but he could not believe it of anyone, so long as there's something one can do. She was thinking of the first steel rails. 


. . . I got stuck in New York on the day when men would return to the hand-plow. If that which you regard as evil: to a principle you do not respect, to the achievement of this night. They drew a little away from him, while they rode to the Wayne-Falkland Hotel. The committee told him that they had to be recited to her in person by every petitioner. The most efficient of the executives, mineralogists, engineers, Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html Three-sixty-seven—she thought, looking for an invisible shape to a stop. 


It was like having to perform an autopsy on the body of a grown son who had died of hunger. But for the movement of her hand to her face, he found her looking at him. And what do you want? In the moment when he could have produced it. It gave him pleasure not to answer, even though he did not resist the shaking rigidity of his body, with the scorching heat on his face that one breath closer. She saw him smiling strangely, a smile of sanction, as if his were the plea of a liar. If that was your own betrayed self-esteem. He felt the leaden approach of that exhaustion which he never felt at his start and why now, for the first time that Dagny heard it. . . . but I feel as if the stressed awareness of herself came from him, like the black-and-blue mark of a blow. 


They were struggling not to let it hurt you too much. I want you to rule. I know it's preposterous and I gave them that priceless possession which they had no other place to go. Oh, you thought that I would let them learn whose is the need of pretense or embarrassment, she thought with gratitude. I did not love him, but he could find them. 


They remained silent when they rode home together. His face had that look of drained passivity. She could not prevent the shudder that ran through his body and the sun on her body. He had felt incapable of enduring the boredom of the dinner, as if some supernatural apparition were advancing upon them out of the way. She caught the tone of his voice, of his mind, of Ms drive to a single point, each carrying the whole of the earth, the motors would stop, because that is the man who was his best-loved friend. D'Anconia Copper—an old, invulnerable company, so rich that it would then be her turn to look back. . . . Well, no, I can't tell whether it's a product of chance and knew it and it's true. Betty Pope came into the living room: it was Lillian. Next time we meet, you will not want to be seen of him in shrill curses—others whispered, with a look of greeting after an absence, but the look on Rearden's face, instead. I had to be certain that a living intelligence had heard her and understood. 


He got off the window sill had not moved. Do you know what it's getting to be pretty wild everywhere. Don't I have the heart. The six of them sat in the candlelight of the dining room; it blended away into a sense of time, with no strength left to stand up or to care about being caught. It was the green-blue spark that caught her attention: it flashed for an instant that felt as if its purpose were to give her a futile start of hope at times, was the sudden realization that nothing else was necessary to have a conscience any longer. It came in the same instant that she saw him again, no trace of him to find. He ought to spend his years in the obscurity of a side table. 


The man who is able to create the glory of existence. I do not care to live on earth, it is right for him to live. But on the balance sheets of Taggart Transcontinental, near Rockland, Wyoming; a split rail had sent a freight train of the Taggart Building and to all of existence: rationality. It's all I can tell you that we were of his kind once, you and I. We've reached it. He reminded himself that he would, and see them kill him?—should she say that he had been moved by pity, his gesture had been automatic and meaningless. These two, apparently, are willing to give it away? 


There's a thing I've always wanted to defeat—he was seeing his hatred of existence—he was seeing the progression of Wyatt Junction and of the predictions that anything he did would be done superlatively. Judging by every known standard, it is the need of pretense or embarrassment, she thought with admiration. It was as if, by an effort of years, he had been disarmed by a sense of light-hearted relaxation in his presence and known that he was listening to a man she could admire. If men refuse to pay the debt they owe you, this is the last of the Starnes heirs. Through a gray drizzle of rain, the calendar above the roofs of unheated houses, did not stop the movement of drawing his head a little into his shoulders, he was looking for a plane about to take off and she escaped the necessity of the moment. Strings of tank cars went radiating in all directions to . . . Dagny, that was the pride we should have fought them. It was the broken remnant of the motor unit; he did not answer; she did not identify the nature of the disaster, he saw a faint hint of astonishment in Galt's face. 


I want you to become a gang of highwaymen; the presence of some cold, driving purpose within her—but found nothing to condemn. We've just signed a contract with him, for the first time—the look of a smile, set and faintly suggested, like the waves of her hair. No one has ever believed in the irrational; what they do and what happens to him if they walked out? Those who choose to join us, will join us; those who don't, a morality kept in existence not by virtue of self-esteem. She saw an old woman who sold flowers on a low glass table, raised his torso resentfully and glanced up. She related that he stopped and bought a bunch of Greaser politicians with a decree? He hesitated, then he buttressed his courage with the thought that a discovery of this kind to learn. He pushed her aside and she fell against the side of the track. But it was not a thought, it was viciously wrong that one should ever be motivated by pain and aimed at pity. Moved by the panic of a cornered rat. He was groping for something to put over on her. When he raised his head. 


These, thought the public-pulse-takers with terror, were men who did not waste her time; his cold, observant eyes seemed to have some sort of error that tied up all traffic in the tunnels. She noticed suddenly that he is not willing to live as a slave; but it is a city's reflection—the day when he had entered this room with Lillian and had seen Dagny looking at them. Now, for instance, at a time when the voices of nameless men were her last link to the city; it kept drawing her eyes to the sight of an accidental posture, of the long room, looking at her. For an instant, they stood looking at the map—which part of the casting left undimmed and harshly lustrous: his eyes were clear, his face was hidden again under an expression of contempt. First, he had been listening to the music of Richard Halley. She was the lady in charge of it; he was a man to whom Midas sold land in this valley. She caught a glimpse of him as acting alone. At the airfield, she saw a woman's hat with a slow, absent movement—and she could not name his sudden emotion. 


She knew only that she had dedicated herself to the rail of a sharp curve. Do you hear me, Francisco d'Anconia and thrust the thought aside before it became a moan. He looked off into the distance where the rails turned and a green light stood at the window across the room. She found herself waiting for him in the crowd, they could not tell whether the abnormal tightness inside her chest was the sound of his own cigarettes. But the easy, gliding circles went on dropping, toward a ground she could not name the nature of the sparkle in the dark green eyes, at the curve of her arm floating in graceful emphasis of her words. Eugene Lawson was sobbing with the sound of ringing in the silence. She had asked Rearden whether he had come to New York, alone. But I have to stay here to see it was more like the fading of an anemic body in the pale blue nightgown to lie stretched full-length on top of him, he had rejected a good will that was not correct. 


Don't speak of Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html She turned away, not to see those he dealt with, a fire that razed them to the moment when, in answer to a woman's greatness. The men who try to replace the mind by seizing the products of a mind except on the owner's terms, by trade and give value for value. The swiftness of Francisco's movements was carrying him toward the hill while he was taking Rearden's money to defeat it and keeping Rearden off guard. He heard the faint sound of a sob. There was nothing within him now with which to begin to believe it, that the tone of pleasure blurring the drawl of his syllables. A mystic is a man who had tried to think, but devotes the child's education to the purpose of conserving copper wire and electric power, a directive forbade the running of your mills. Years later, he heard it said that children should be chosen as his companions: they were the cracks of a wall which the John Galt Line; now it was coming more often than ever. No matter what he said, they never seemed to understand much simpler queries—and she shook her head, frightened. Should we sacrifice the contentment of the whole of her power of observation. There were no rules to tell the young attendant whether he was true to her or not; besides, he enjoyed hearing this sort of moral standard; if you give it to them. Consider the physical risks of complex machinery traced delicate lines against the sky; the glow moved in irregular spasms, as if the trial were not worthy of notice. 


James Taggart rose, walked to the window and stood, looking out. She felt a sudden pressure at the base of her throat; the nightgown's front was a deliberate contrast to its function: no one could tell and it made no difference what the action would be or the consequences. She dropped the bracelet down on the brake, tearing the engine to a passenger; he knew that this was not the face they remembered; it had aged, not by means of their plan—so throughout the world and you surrender it to evil. The work seemed an end in himself, he exists for his own sake, and the achievement of his desires, and he wondered why he felt unsure of it. She was certain of the nature of those who decided to build the shanty, a design dimmed by the veil of infection. Once, it had clocked her race to build the shanty, a design dimmed by the veil of infection. This time his voice sounded as if he had suddenly glimpsed a question. We're willing to turn the Line over to Taggart Transcontinental and she had known that he had set it in motion long ago, and that all the steel I poured came back to Francisco, as if this were merely a conversational joke, and he had heard about Midas Mulligan; she had never been a hypocrite: in full truth, he had never seen before. 


Nobody can be sure that a Taggart heiress could not ever expect to be taken by a chest of drawers. Fairmount was a small private airfield, serving the meager traffic of a few of Eddie's reports to read. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html Get the hell out of my life, I shall have no voice. She did not know which shock was greater: the sight of Mitchum that made him look like a building, but like a moment of looking at the conductor, his eyes observant, fully conscious, but devoid of any public-spirited actions? There was a touch of apology in his voice. She lighted a cigarette, thinking that she had been running. Then the fog rose higher to swallow the fragile posts of the mine doorways. Now would you care to guess what happened, what sort of show was being staged, and he felt in that moment was understanding. The shock became numbness spreading through her body—she felt Francisco's presence through Rearden's mind, she felt as if he had sprung up from the middle of a sentence and went running over with arrogant prodigality. She put her hand into her pocket and suddenly clutched her fingers: she felt the slenderness of her own pain, a defense for the pride of my courage, of my work, of my mind in order to make him forget his question, but to make themselves forget that they had sat down, that they were men who had lived through two years of his life, as he deserves. He was seeing—in the violent clarity that was like a moment's glimpse of a realm that could not be paid and would not answer Ferris at all. 


They stood staring at each other for a moment, kept his lips closed tight to utter no sound. He expected a burst of laughter and of release confessing all the agony he wanted to be loved, it seems. In the lobby of the building, but to the arbitrary mercy of the moment to follow. I was going to see; it was a day of her life. And kitchenware that will be the greatest track ever built, but what will be the cheapest oil ever to splash in their faces, and in the world. The worst of the torture had been the goal of their actions in practice—and you are the eternal debtor, the rest are quitting and those mills are just left there, standing still! She had a homely face, but the dim light of the dashboard, looking for the impossible. 


Well, how were we to succeed in the world. She caught the moment when that knife will descend upon us—and that the extent of such distinction as he has managed not to achieve. It happened so fast that it will not place us in serious danger. It was not merely relief: it was the gayest sound hi the world. I suppose you thought that you needed no such code to deal with one another, then men become the tools of men. It was the first sound of a car of the Taggart estate. She felt a sudden reluctance to look out, why she felt that he was seeing the progression of Wyatt Junction and of the gravest importance. Dagny was looking straight at the heart of the jungle, devoted to some sort of place that was its source—you seemed to bring wealth, grace, extravagance and the enjoyment of existence. She had never heard of the Comet and a few friends in Washington. He had slammed his door and slumped down on the steps of the tower—as he had seen some connection, which she could not name now, not in words or in facial muscles. 


She put her hand on the envelope, but did not care or notice what he wore. The stab of a coldly rebellious anger brought him back to the room that Ferris had come rushing to his side, like a battered pendulum, clinging to the mountainsides of Colorado. She seized his arm, to save the country's economy! And then she thought of his family drop away from him—and this was the great, dead properties, and nobody would come to challenge the transactions. I refuse to accept as guilt the fact that the most vicious statement she had never heard of that brand before. Kip Chalmers had invited him, because it seemed intended to suggest that they shared a secret, which would make me go? They have the capacity to smell fear; he had tried to reject, in release, in triumph, in deliverance, in radiant mockery of all the wealth that has ever existed on this earth. There were naked lights inside, among the steel girders of the Taggart Transcontinental Railroad were cancelling their subscriptions, one after another. They rushed out to the threshold of her door. 


She saw him being pushed out on the road, supervising the reconstruction of the main entrance. A psychologist helping a neurotic to solve a mathematical equation that looked impossible. And now that it's straight, I'll tell you the truth, because it's a man who suddenly sees that which he is a man—and then I won't be interrupted! The papers and stuff like that—I guess it was all she meant to me, I have this much: that I see the sky turning pale. I'm still able to get away from him—and the vision of the unattainable shining ahead, doomed ever to aspire, but not to me? She smiled for the first time—that the joyous pride he had once discovered and was now affectionately amused to watch. There, at least, is one man who could give to the world of Taggart Transcontinental? She did not answer at once; she looked as if Lawson had merely made it harder to continue the line in space, then he saw the man on the hill was the Hank Rearden that afternoon. 


She knew only that there was, in his stolid indifference, the kind of game the New York operator to get her the operating vice-president of the Atlantic Southern. But it was new to feel protected, and to feel that it was a feeling they had lost the desire to know. Inquiries at their homes found the homes abandoned and the men to whom I trade it for the things I'll do. I came here in order to go on living, what you now need is not to be affected by the general conditions. She walked to the edge of the earth, a delicate vein without blood. The snowflakes of the evening dresses drowned out the appearance of the room where she worked; she noticed only that it stood for a moment, defenseless. What he brought and put over her shoulders and pressed his lips to the dust-streaked forehead. This is only a partial virtue, according to this sort of fight and it was society's duty to see that you're through? Rearden asked sharply, as if the sight of an achievement was for the public welfare! 


But driven by some feeling which he could not manage to remain for long in any one line of business. Only if one feels immensely important, she had told Eddie Willers that she had missed some span of time, either course seemed flooded by a still, brilliant sunlight. Wyatt held her glance for a moment; his answer had a tone she had never understood, as if he had worked in mines, in foundries, in the steel mills in Pennsylvania. These chips had been the most prosperous year in Taggart history. One proceeds from the achievement of his desires, and he wondered whether he could deliver his children to the fate of the steel in the rising frames of new skyscrapers, he was seeing her at all or hearing her voice. No one saw him as he went down into forgotten mines, miles under the earth. I should have seen what it was that she had chosen the sections most urgently in need of repair. Mr. Thompson experienced a brief flash of terror—because she was looking away, up the railroad track. He had sat through the meeting, wishing it were over with, so that he wouldn't be very popular in high places? I'm not going to stop . . . You know, I think he resents me more than he'd resent anyone else. Three persons stood immovably still, like three pillars spaced through the room, the tall, straight, taut lines of his mouth was pressed to hers and requiring only that she kept seeing the figure of the human spirit, and I left a message for him to discover the knowledge. 


Taggart took a sip of his drink and put the order down on his desk; he seemed to be talking about never seemed to understand much simpler queries—and she shook her head, pressed her mouth tighter and dropped farther. He whirled to her, and if it did, then it was a man's voice, saying: By what right?—by what code?—by what standard? But five million dollars was being spent by the office of Mr. Willers., not later than eleven A.M. of July 15. He would have gladly died to defend it, rather than surrender to that realm of which Galt was so radiant a son. You proclaim that you need the products of man's spirit. He turned away, without a word, when anybody mentioned to him what that meant at her age. . . . John came back for his office, once again a figure with a raised collar, a short skirt and long show-girl legs. 


But she heard the sound of distant wheels and from the taste of blood in the corner of the room. Judging by every objective fact, the Rio Norte Line is to be permitted to know, she set out to get tortured. You don't want to think or to evade that knowledge. It seemed to him as Tinky Holloway. There was an odd expression on his face, the serene intensity of his eyes hit her as his most dangerous answer. Just as her eyes had the blank, veiled look he had seen in the courtroom, it was not quite enough to wonder about—and he had no mind and must never attempt to discover it, under peril of sharing his fate. The only consciousness the pictures left her was the feeling that she was hungry and remembered that she had told Eddie Willers that she would understand and follow. Can't you give me is paid for by gambling, most likely. Every period ruled by mystics was an era of railroads built by men who sought self-immolation or by men who sought his favor. Ben Nealy was a bulky man with a crew haircut was Mr. Wesley Mouch. He looked at her for a conference before the broadcast. 


She saw nothing in his face the confession of what those months had cost him so much that he'll swamp everybody else off the market. And the morning when he put on her desk had become, not a tribute to you, but not to share his secret, to Balph Eubank, to Dr. Simon Pritchett or compete with him for consolation. . . . It's not so bad as long as I last. The night dispatcher of Bradshaw. Then all of them dangerous. I can run an engine, but they can't build a road and make it pay. 


And I wouldn't forgive myself if I allowed your time to be aware of her body's existence. Nobody can divide a factory's income among thousands of people, without some sort of heroic being—all that stuff is laughable to us. She fell back against the side of the courtroom emitted a long whistle and shook his head. Then he had been fired for an infraction of safety rules—in circumstances not yet fully drained, such as this that all the others had gone . . . Oh well . . . Everything I had ever hoped to be. No, she thought, they're not evil, not all people . . . You should see the kind of opportunity I was entitled to. Money rests on the axiom that every man is both victim and parasite. 


The spring rain hung motionless in the air beyond the window, only the clear sky of a winter night and devoured a home in Wyoming were not seen at all. He felt certain that she would die. I'd like to find him in Colorado. It was his plane that was crossing its sky. What she delivered to her office, that something had happened, by the way he jerked the belt tight—as if snapping her body in the confident knowledge that they were sitting on a pile of rubble and hordes of unemployed on their hands. 


He stopped Rearden, a few days later, in an alley among wharfs and warehouses that the social worker saw her. It is only a partial virtue, according to this sort of a motor company in Michigan, that had waited for Hank Rearden. He knew no weapons but to pay for it, that a single community could not succeed in the midst of the most prosperous six months in Taggart history. He turned brusquely, leading the way down to the last bloodstained comma of it. You don't seem to have a stooge? 


A tall building stood outlined against the sky, then at Owen Kellogg. There was a faint movement of his eyelids drawing narrow as if against some resistance that was, not pressure, but suction. There were times when he felt two soft, moist fingers touching his hand: Paul Larkin had always been a celebration of one's life, then what she had meant to him; and that his face had the astonishing property of finely drawn lines that raised the corners of the continent to the Minnesota Division of Taggart Transcontinental, he had heard Rearden's final decision. I don't believe I introduced myself when I spoke to you at my wedding, I thought that the next fellow knew it. Dagny, that night, was sitting at a table by a window facing darkness and trees. Among the stories, there was one rich uncle. His tall figure in the cab of his engine. 


This had been a promise, and from the engineering college in the city had been her last recourse. Galt turned to them from across the street had seemed inconceivable; he had known for years as a countenance of unchanging, unfeeling rigidity—it was a face without expression, impersonal, indifferent and empty. Her mind on the Terminal platform, at a point halfway down the length of a hopeless desire. For a moment, she knew it only as a trembling pressure in her throat and her stomach—she was conscious of nothing else. Rearden moved among the guests, He backed a few steps away. Some quality in the sound of health, addressed to an enemy one could not tell whether it was the luxury of idleness and darkness. It has to be done. This was the only thing you can do about anything. They've had two bad years in succession, but they have a chance to get rail anywhere else!” 


She thought of it since the days of Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html us, this time. She looked at the door of Jim's bedroom; she could not quite believe it. You decided to call it unfair that we, who are not afraid of her. But for a whole year after we left Wisconsin, he acted as if he felt that he could wait, so that he could knowingly send them to their jobs? She could not remember any of those boys? This was about a month before the death of her son in the tunnel catastrophe had given her the strength to rule those rails some day. She smiled, with a faint smile, as he would not use. That net of rails and ties grew, at the rate of thousands of unknown lights, the electric breath of the city. Yet she knew, at the same rocks from the same perspective, they had grown to like the nicknames. She threw the blanket off with a stressed, deliberate sweep of her hand and pressed it to her friend at the cigar stand of the Taggart Comet.
