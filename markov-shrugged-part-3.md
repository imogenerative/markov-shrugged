## Chapter 1


It seemed to be doing well, he had a staff for the not doing of anything, so he didn't have us to throw alms to? Some crudely childish form of self-deception had made them aware of Hank Rearden as he sat looking at the silent receiver. No matter what discipline was required of him, he had rejected in order to support and a widowed sister with three children. Dave Mitchum was not the person of Mr. Mowen, president of the company in person. But his eyes, his hand moving over her breasts as if he felt no desire to sleep with you? 


The man who lies to the world, claiming to be indispensable—except the men who were not disinterested. And if you wish to perish for the privilege of strength, but I—I have the right to be light-hearted. Taggart was sitting on a balustrade as if it were a bundle of old clothing about to be crushed between two walls advancing upon him: he had no capacity for the enjoyment of life back to their car in silence. They were vanishing quietly into a veil of fog, with the faint hint of astonishment in his face; this was not the world I will expect you to change your mind, you don't have to do it now. He looked at her as if her mind were racing, she could not name his sudden emotion. When she tore her mouth away from him, as if studying an object seen for the first time. 


She could not believe that they may seize my property to collect the fine—I will not volunteer to pay it. They watched her rush by with oddly furtive glances, as if they were a private treasure of his own. He wore an old leather jacket, and even in the actual fact, but in the eyes of everyone she meets, what she will see in the eyes of youth looking at the glittering white splashes on the dark windows of a train due to leave for Washington in a few years. The road went past it and climbed on into the darkness of the shed, the red glare of furnaces melting copper—as it stood in the middle of the room, the tall, straight, taut lines of his profile and the green-blue cord coiling through space. They're the kind of game the men behind her. The newspapers had snarled that the cause of all our current fears and doubts. I know that he's the only one whose controlling stock remained in the hands of those who were not disinterested. 


He held her arm and started toward his car. He knew that the lights would flare up at any moment by an attack that would Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html seeking; the words were: the sanction of reason—as no advocate of contradictions can claim it. But he felt as if she were not seen by the glare of the floodlights which no one else describe it as a solid object: he learns to identity it as a moral value, as the coin of their realm, as more sacred than right and life. Only the skin of their faces went rolling back into the discipline of a purpose—then at the sagging boards and crumbling plaster of the garret. He wanted to utter an enthusiastic compliment, but the smile vanished abruptly; he saw the answer to some special question in his mind that went on throwing words at him; it was the gayest sound hi the world. To tell you the reason and you will be free to die in the next moment. A tall building stood outlined against the sky, then at Owen Kellogg. But profit, ma'am, depends on what you wish to continue the line in space, then he saw the strands of rail. There's only one mining company that's lucky enough not to be gauged by matters not open to his choice is a mockery of nature. The cafeteria was almost deserted—but the first thing men will sacrifice. She did not know, she could not see his eyes, only his mouth drawn in lines of longing. 


A design was still visible on its peeling strips, imprinted in the dead gray of the hills looked like the secret retreat of some great defiance or sorrow. This was the first case of its kind, but I had to laugh, I was so glad to see that we never delivered an order on time and never put out a new motor of the same unbroken loyalty, but the sound of that particular moment, of herself and her own movement. Every single one of them was young and tall. You've got the rest of her life. He stumbled dazedly to his feet, he went catching at the furniture for support. 


Some of the passengers that he had wanted to think of that is to be permitted to decide anything. He would not give him the pleasure of others? Right at the moment, in the task of shock absorber for his fragile burden, to the task of shock absorber for his fragile burden, to the task of pouring the wine, filling the three vessels on the map? What is it that they expect to depend on, when they lie on an operating table when the electric light went out? . . . But it was the older man; he felt the response of some living, thinking mind. Whatever you wish me to exist somewhere in the forest through long stretches of calm, when she was sixteen, looking at a reflection. . . . Since then...fortwoyears...withnotamoment'srespite...Doyouknowwhatit'slike,towantit?Would youwishtohearwhatIthoughtwhenIlookedatyou...whenIlayawakeatnight...whenIheard your voice over a telephone wire . . . She heard no answer, only the clanking of the chains. 


Your brother James and his friends knew nothing about his world, that the extent of such distinction as he has managed not to achieve. He telephoned her office to open without announcement. She threw it at his face, it struck his cheek and fell down on his knees by the white glare of a spotlight. Even though everything within the house was of her own detachment, as if it had not. To reach him in time, was the only person in the world and the richest! Where was the inventor of the motor, but these were too small to be of value: it gave him her whole answer: pain, admiration, understanding. It was useless to comment, but the words sounding like a cry. 


She was watching him with a slow, deliberate movement, as if telling him that he did not; yet, seeing her, he knew that he would fail. I know what I mean. There was a great example for all businessmen to follow—a businessman with a sense of privacy as if it had been bent when she had seen on their last run. She smiled in answer to the same values. The afternoon newspaper was lying on the desk with a casual, imperious gesture, the gesture of his arm pointed at the dark drop, at the rise of rock beyond it, at the sun on a Diesel engine. It was half-lowered, its eyes looking up at the sky, feeling no desire to resist it. 


I'd like to find the line of his lips was a smile. Sitting beside him in his office, above the spread of the sky was an even, deep, deceptively clear blue that blended with the walls of the houses for new installations. The glow of the moon and the deader glow in the sky; the glow moved in irregular spasms, as if the necessity to name its own nature—escape from the necessity to dress, unwilling to delay the exciting game of his business duties. He stood waiting, as if he owned the room which he had not expected her to mean it. He had to stop him. There was nothing but bitterness now, in his smile and his sudden sense of uneasiness, she had wondered—as she wondered about the reason of his decision. Dagny stood in the middle of the sidewalk, wondering what gave him a sense of double reality in the stillness of the town. Francisco's eyes were watching Dagny, as if some conscious impulse were behind every sudden, tearing rise that went up to cut off the realization that it was tension, but the tension of the knowledge she had earned in the valley. Yes, ma'am, we voted on it in a rocking coach through the beat of the city were physical objects without any meaning. We must stand united among ourselves and united with the rest of her life on this spot and in this manner. 


No, she thought—as she walked through the streets of New York—Don't let it go!—while he was seeing nothing around her, but the intensity of what he had promised to do. He looked at her silently for a moment somewhere among men, and vanishes. Do you know what rights mean to a man caught on an operating table when the electric light bulbs again, from off the staircase, down where I live. Just take a look at an electric generator and dare tell yourself that it was I who made this possible. And more: this would mean that he, Mitchum, would have to leave her—he wondered whether he should leave now, without seeing her, so that he won't give anything produced by my mind should be used to bring them comfort. Life is the reward for all my days—and as if he did not know how many industrialists had retired and vanished five years ago, it will ruin me. Somebody is always sacrificed, as a rule unjustly; there is no more than a faint, tremulous crease of her mouth, a girl staggering blindly, not knowing sidewalks from pavements. She glanced at her and chuckled; it was a look of youth, of early morning, of gratitude to the fact that we had to be first to smash against it. 


Rearden asked sharply, as if the whole goddamn universe. And if there's anyone who wants to do it, and I knew that you'd despise a playboy more than any other man on. earth. Her work was all she would ever have of the world or man's greatness as its motive power and the radiant vision within him which had seen the brief pause of his hands were urging her to stand looking at him, her eyes stretched by a silent question. Galt drank, and raised himself to lean on an elbow to look down at the floor, as if afraid to glance up at this moment. It was an odd look, as if her senses had merged, so that she could not abandon an incalculable wealth such as the State Science Institute, because, even though he was only a joyous feeling that seemed like a small ballroom aboard a submarine, was the most joyous face he had hoped to switch to the Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html the supporter of his own car and the sight of a prairie, in the hills, on the ledges and brought the mountains into the Jiving finality of a form. I thought that any sort of light was the door of a shop, the black hole open upon miles of uninhabited wilderness where no one would ever learn that he had had a warning and that he had not reported. It stopped her abruptly; she took a cigarette: it bore the letterhead of Rearden Steel. 


It was the mother of a man who stood in a bottle on the table. There were flashlights on the market, as well as I do. He glanced briefly at her living room, looking at her, as if he were held on display in the sight of an achievement was the greatest gift a human being for miles. She smiled, as she took a cigarette: it bore the sign of the dollar on the pedestal under his feet. That much irrationality is not possible in self-abasement, only in self-exaltation, only in the realm of thought—as she lay in bed, propped up on pillows of pale green linen. 


A sparkling net of snow flashed into sight once in a while, to look back and saw the glance intended for heroes—given to him by the brusque, confident manner of a last look at one another. The anteroom of her office flew open and James Taggart sat on the desk in his office when his ore mines were taken away from me, it's what I've never had. He saw, once in a while, with the energy of living. Then men like Cuffy Meigs will devour the last of his possessions—the gesture of a signal, directing some invisible task. He glanced at the conductor. And I know what you've done to Jim and those who produce it—and if moral values are set in contradiction to its nature. The leader spread his hands out in a gesture of confident pride, as if his glance were saying: If this is what he gave up. All that Dagny wanted of life was contained in the desire to hold her in the impersonal manner of a feeling which he could now distinguish to be a barrier in her way. If a man refuses to sell his convictions, it is not to know, not to grasp or name or hear the voice of a businessman, the sound of the wheels against the glass of the windowpanes. Eddie was watching her as if he were to die, she thought, to build a railroad branch from Texas into the wilderness of San Sebastian. He mixed the drinks in silence, while she waited obediently, sitting on the grass, with his head leaning against Kay Ludlow's knees. 


She saw a glaring sunlight, a stretch of the earth's crust mangled in the days of ten years she had found it; she told him that she had no way of knowing what was necessary to save the country. I will have a reason that they do not wish to succeed any longer. He did not know why it was so gray and ugly. She felt lifted to her feet in the soft twilight of Mulligan's living room: Galt, whose face had the same look. I'll support your application, if you want to see the ledges of mountains, where no buildings had been known to exist. Now you wish to go back, you will be right to damn me. I always thought that any sort of blue evening gown? But the looters—by their own stated theory—are in desperate, permanent, congenital need and at the root of their theories, death is the goal and the reward of evil. 


When a shock raced through his chest, the gold-copper strands of his hair— then across the belt of his slacks, had the rapid precision of an engineer pulling the levers of a half-dismembered typewriter. His body will not obey him, it will not give you virtue and it will not place us in serious danger. He had never held that creed, but he had done to wreck his life, this was still the Francisco d'Anconia in the crowd. She sat on the desk with a casual, contemptuous movement of his proudly intractable mouth curving into the hint of a smile on his face was too well known to them and to that extent, is a man, and I —I am only the man who feeds them—and they lick the hand of the clock reached the instant of four. She looked up at the ceiling of the room, with the look of being spent. Such was the code accepted by the world, that it was the only sign of age. 


They're just selling their right to what they were recognizing. He looked straight at her and did not know why it seemed so miserably senseless to me—after what I felt like doing! They seemed to have some quality in his terror, out of proportion to the sums extorted from them. He's given me nothing but a few rare, lonely streaks of lighted glass without masonry. It was said inoffensively; he was a man to put in his place. Bertram Scudder was staring at her; this was not the black Hammond, but a long, gray convertible. The implications of this knowledge were among the things she feared or give them the benefit of it? Maybe there's nothing you can now pretend to hope, to want or to seek. It took them a moment to look at newspaper mentions of Taggart Transcontinental, wearing a semi-military tunic and leather leggings; the flesh of his neck bulged over the collar, and the flesh of his neck bulged over the edge of open riots and violence—order must be maintained by any means available. She went on, seeing nothing around her, but the nature of the looter-in-spirit, a thing I don't share. . . . if there was no time for theories, when everything is falling to pieces, nobody is producing any longer. Her only power was the power of the saints—only it was not the knowledge of that which she knew to be outside her power, yet she knew with certainty that it would then be her turn to look back. 


You understand . . . Sure, I know who's going to move it. She became suddenly conscious of her hands, as if one felt, without contact, the sensation of proud chastity with which he had not slept for three nights. He did not know that she had been facing for days, as if this were the only face that had nothing to do in such an emergency. Its rising lines cut the sky, with half of the mountains rolling after. I have no rights and that you would be likely to break. Man's good—say both—is to give up his bridge, because he was not safe among them any longer, but neither would anyone else . . . No, I guess I am. He threw the door closed after him, then resumed their seats; they did not stop, with the crowds of people who had lived in chronic tension to withstand the shock of people who had known how this was to be the subject they were actually discussing. 


He threw the door open for her. Let them destroy your railroad and my mills, but don't give it to me as an example of his betters, for guidance in learning to think; but the music remained on the edge of the bed—and she smiled, noticing that the stern formality of his manner; she could not tell why her words bit him as they did. But in those years he was still honest about his job, and he felt that he had to perform remained on the edge of a path, holding on to Galt's arm on one side and a single star above a smokestack with the vertical lettering: Rearden Steel. He was a man in military uniform at some official proceedings where emotions could not be certain, as yet, that Daniels would solve the secret of converting static energy into kinetic power. She had had to be obstructed. We won't have to see it was more truly this last; and she felt no tremor under the pressure of forcing itself not to outdistance incompetence. 


By the evening of the fourth knocks, the steps of an enemy moving toward some inexorable purpose. In the name of my wife will give you the means for the subhuman as the end? The face of the mechanic in charge of it now, who used to leap out of bed to face an issue is to believe that I am able to do this, among other things. They were both incapable of the conception that joy is the aim and the core of my guilt. Dr. Stadler felt no horror, he felt nothing, it was not on a railroad platform that I was wrong. She looked at him with a fine smile of amusement, yet holding nothing but fear and malice. 


## Chapter 2


We knew our jobs and we produce, by the effort of extracting them. She did not expect him to do it at any moment. She sat still, her eyes closed; she was thinking of his wife, his mother and Philip, he had said about times of loneliness. . . . Everything I had ever seen him smile. It was a gray morning, dark with rain clouds, the explosion had broken an unwritten code which demanded that he give them a raise, but how can they afford to exist when the cost of their clothes and the leather leggings of a traffic cop. 


Rearden sat looking at a blank face and the well-bred manner of genteel poverty. To hell with New York and Philadelphia, but would be paid according to his ability, to each according to his ability, but would be paid according to its need. She strained back, trying to draw away from him, while they rode to the Wayne-Falkland Hotel. The boy was known to every railroad employee in the district at his immediate call. He did not mention the details of it. 


It's not true, and I don't think they trust me any more. It was a Hammond convertible, its top down, one of the men she met at her first ball. You're not interested in any of those boys? Two men held a white silk ribbon stretched across the track in front of the crackling blue void of an empty street—and a stab of urgency; the rest seemed meaningless. It was a tall, emaciated man, with jerky movements, a sallow face and the young, triumphant smile that she had no time to wait. It was the swift, instinctive, ferocious gesture of a courageous man defying their opinion, and she was not to produce gadgets, but to do good. She sat in the fireman's chair and glanced across at Logan once in a while, with the energy of living. When lie lay exhausted, his eyes closed, and thought of the man who is now on trial for refusal to comply with a government order. They looked far out into the morning air. Eddie looked astonished; it had never been able to obtain from them. It would be of no benefit to them and kissed his hand. 


He did not seem astonished to see a face that's intelligent though a woman's. Now—well, I’ll tell you about it right now. The shock to him was that he did not; yet, seeing her, he had known that this salute was his. The fear of being seen, or of seeing, so that the glowing patch on her forehead and miles of forest spread under her feet. But the moment ended in an invisible shudder: she would not conclude it, because she thought she would not order dinner in her car, but would go to the airport. Who wants a nation of profit-seekers and dollar-grubbers. Then she knew that neither of them wanted to have to deal with your mind, but to deal, instead, with your gun. The country is full of rumors, all sorts of rumors, about everything, all of them were skeptical about the new metal. 


Yet nothing was distant and nothing was firm or certain. Slowly, with the greatest effort of his generosity—he would not believe that the values of my code. Just raise a lot of trick metals. He'll be glad to know that he is the sort of pleasure one expects, but seldom finds, in the motions of stirring the stew, hatefully, paying no attention to spare for her interests, not even enough to learn just what they were. They listened to the Fourth Concerto, her head thrown back, not moving, wishing she would never want to see me crawling before you? She smiled, half-raising her hand in a vague motion, indicating the length of the motor and saw the silver body of a soldier sprawled on the ground. She wanted to wrest from him an acknowledgment of the fact that if you pay the bills, that's enough, don't you? 


He had the direct, imperious manner of an owner undressing a person whose sole means of access, guarded by soldiers in full battle regalia. In the lighted doorway, the length of her sprawled body. Rearden's face was the one he wanted most at this moment was too much even for him. You were willing to break their moral code and to bear damnation for the sin of intelligence, to perish on the altars of others, is giving you death as your standard of value. He stood at the window of Mulligan's study. You knew it, no matter what you feel for him, it will not place us in serious danger. And they don't know whether he was torturing Francisco or himself. They were now disposed of: one was dead, three were left in the coal industry who amounts to much, except Ken Danagger. 


The passers-by at the factories, the bridges, the electric signs, the billboards pressing down upon the central chair, in the manner of a cornered rat. When the camera flashed the image of a man's willingness to speak, but knew that it was useless to think of performing it in order to avert a national disaster. He smiled again with that insolently personal quality which now seemed to hold pain and an almost wistful longing, or why he was looking past her, straight ahead, at the crane in the distance. I am trying to find an anchor somewhere. It is possible for men to abandon their sight of it, a quality of possessiveness and of unhesitant perception, as if he were pleading. Days passed before she realized that she was supposed to owe an uncle or a grandfather. She was looking up at the superintendent of his rolling mills who had resigned and vanished within the past month. He jerked her closer, to stifle the sight and his power to deny its existence. This was the danger: that she would win—the relief came from the certainty that the ugliness Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html to dismiss it; there was nothing to read in it except an unrevealing violence, some part of him which he could not explain. It was right there, on the construction site by the river, their shorts and shirts torn in their climb to the top. The old lady died the night before she was to leave for Washington in a few sharp strokes that made things seem clean, important—and worth doing. 


It was that night that I took the oath never to let oneself or others understand anything down to the underground tunnels of Taggart Transcontinental. You blank out the fact that the Washington planners found it necessary to lead our enemies to this valley. You're not going to stop . . . You'd better stop them now, if you can. He felt like the wind of its speed. She turned to a long, smooth streak, when they saw him moving among his guests. That was the evil, the sort of position which most of the businessmen envied. The pavement shrank to a narrow path between two walls advancing upon him: he had lost respect for her judgment long ago. A sort of challenge, I guess . . . like waves rolling to swallow the fragile posts of the street lamp that had once thrown a stranger's shadow across the pavement, describing the course of any battle, willing to cash in on the profits of the men who count. Undressing for bed in the darkness of the sky, a sight as life-giving as a sunrise. He hunted around for a pencil and thrust them into her hands—she seized them, as if she were studying intently some revelation that had never confronted her before. Rearden looked at his office as if she lay in the silence between them: wonder as to how much had been achieved on the edge of the table, filled with marigolds, grapes and carrots. Her head dropped slowly, and she closed her eyes with a faint tinge of red trembling over its smokestack. 


She had marked the date, as she did in this moment—and she noted, in astonishment, her sudden feeling that made Rearden realize the nature of her laughter. By a sort of interest in men, no romantic inclination whatever. Its output seems to be the day before he quit. He stood motionless, held by a child's sensation of joy in the simple task of preparing a breakfast. She started walking slowly up the path to the house, she wondered what were the steps left for her to like Dr. Robert Stadler. The face was like a summation of all the ideas men had held. 


She had been flung at the music, and what followed was the sound of youth, growing in his voice made Mr. Thompson jerk to glance at him, like some irreducible absolute, like an axiom not to be felt as an impediment and not to care whether others approved of him or not, as you wish, and mostly you don't. I hope you're not going to stop, she thought . . . somewhere. And then, for one instant, no longer than for a savage who had never started or lost a battle against himself, now had no power to believe it clearly, in this moment, in this moment's full context, in this city. His companions were still clinging to the radio, as if waiting. She was looking at Galt, He was smiling, family, derisively, as if he were pleased that Dr. Stadler had seen looking up at the dark windows. Francisco stood cornered against the side of the system now in power. Real existence, they tell him, is that which no human mind can know, they say—and proceed to demand that he give them a choice of shots; they had a fresh bolt of ribbon ready. Then she saw some people becoming too polite to her, and his face, incredibly, looked anxious, almost frightened. Seeing her in the circle of the peaks. Nobody can help what he does, that is the root of their bond—this strength of his arms stressed by his short white shirt sleeves. She held his eyes, lying back in space, against the wind, conscious of nothing else. 


Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html all he is worthy of happiness, which means: is worthy of enjoying. He approached her, he grasped her shoulders and pressed his lips to the dust-streaked forehead. But you will discover that you need the other half of your order, let me know. He looked straight at her for a much more civilized use. If so, then your money will not give you the knowledge needed to keep it. She threw the door closed with a casual, imperious gesture, the gesture of a courageous man defying their opinion, and she was locked out by a screen of rays. The looters lost most of their men to you. CHAPTER IV ANTI-LIFE James Taggart reached into the pocket of his white jacket, wiped the counter, working with swift precision. 


The men she had struggled to forget it. Dagny stood, staring at the room, at the sculptured garlands faintly visible in the darkness, beating time. They stared at the new car, not as one on the defensive any longer. Your honesty was like a moan of understanding, amusement and pain. Why did you teach them to bear privations. So, in a way, it pleases me that I could put an end to it, once and for all. I didn't know what they say, man is only a modest beginning. 


No—he thought, looking at the radio, as the last sound of Galt's answer, a relief that told her he was in New York and hear that there's a party going on, I wouldn't miss it for the sake of his greed; they remembered that the man with the genius of a great estate, and mountains slashed by pits of red ore in the distance. Mr. Mowen stated that he would consider later the question of what had made her say it with such urgency and why it should ever have been written: it all seemed so childishly senseless. He would throw that book in the ash can all the drawings I sent you, because . . . I go on working and I keep telling myself that this is a threat to the public welfare, and that railroad bridges across the Mississippi, belonging to smaller railroads, were condemned. Tell the country . . . What honor? You want a stranglehold on your men by means of the irrational, which has but two monuments at the end of the room. The distant rumble of the traffic sounded lower than usual and made the book slide from the corner of a country crossroad. She saw the roofs of skyscrapers, she knew that he was not the form of upward motion, they seemed to be considering some sudden vision of her own. He loved his work; it was his body that refused to move, stunned by shock, while his mind was a failure, that he was seeking strength from it himself. Will I want to see pure evil, you should have discovered for me. 


Just to give our economy a chance to speak to him. She knew she was alone in the old station building, looking at the newspaper on the floor. A distinguished man in shirt sleeves, stood in the middle of the river, far below. There was a long way off and that he would not be able to unscramble it? Then is money made by the strong at the expense of the fools? When she raised her head, and she saw his smile deepening as if he thought that mothers should set out on their way to major in our two subjects within their four years. He had looked straight at Taggart; he merely looked, but his glance was too austerely perceptive. We had to let the government seize my mines, because I am using the best rail ever produced. She was looking off again, and he felt a confident, amused, paternal protectiveness. 


The year to be known as the Steel Unification Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html He looked at her, astonished. She was flying away from it, at the rate of a hundred miles an hour, he had purchased was a process of thought and labor, in which the nature of our enemies. His head fell back, his eyes closed, as if even sight would now be the one to blame for it! The notes flowed up, they spoke of rising and they were like words addressed to the shape of her long, scratched, sunburned legs slanting from the rock into the Hudson, had seen him once, at a reception given by Mrs. Cornelias Pope. The seven others in the room knew who it was that he heard it. On the morning of November 4, Hank Rearden was prompted by my own standards, even while I was the president of Friends of Global Progress. 


He saw her hand trembling as she held her head like an actress on a stage, like a woman in your eyes—let your estimate be your own concern. I completed the experimental model of a motor the like of which we've never seen! Reality demands of man that he act for his own freedom, it is not to be mentioned in the gossip columns; not the kind of opportunity I was entitled to. Rearden looked at the metal. You're becoming a coward—thought Dagny., feeling a causeless jolt of dread at the words, and it had not been made, the automobile that had not been sent to punish. It would be so superior to anything we've got that it would then be her turn to follow. For the first time, the real heart of a man of action. The trail turned, and in a situation as delicate as this. . . . The first time that they had known each other for Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html looked up at the ceiling of the car, by the guilt of ability—we will work to support him as he was, yet remained held by his presence, remained and leaned back in his chair, looking at her with a touch of future pride, a pride to be earned. His hand swept over the crowd once in a while. I had good reason not to expect her till noon. 


The creases of his face had a look of angry malice, and a few who had a look of fear and of oddly lecherous anticipation. Dagny placed the remnant of a drink. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html He had not been able to grasp the full meaning of the unnamed in that special stress. But we can't make an exception in my case. So long as men desire to live does not give or take the undeserved. 


The bah1 was hatred—hatred as his only tool of knowledge—Purpose, as his choice of language, nothing more. I still think that that's what we ought to celebrate. But they were not to delay her. The buildings seemed worn by centuries of anguish. She did not know that this was the horror of it, that there was no recognition of persons in her eyes, when she watched some man who'd talked back to her desk. His reward, say the mystics of muscle, is the pleasure of knowing that I've brought you to this. Then she found herself walking back along the roadbed of the new division superintendent. It was the third of three shipments of copper that could feed the looters. In the next moment, he was struggling to make him suffer, but a confession of weakness: by the rules of their unwritten language, one did not seem to function as they had come from Orren Boyle's Associated Steel. 


Man's mind is the day when she would be in the conquest of a mindless body? He knew what his superiors were doing and he wondered whether he could deliver the radiant being he had seen her stand on the mystic split that divorced man's soul from his body. No, it's not as simple as that?—she thought, but knew that she needed another one, but thought that she would awaken in a world that regards me as a slave. Taggart's eyes swept over the faces around them. He glanced at the ceiling. Yet, facing him, the men who buy them, but no more. The light was ebbing, and Eddie Willers could not believe that they may seize my property to collect the fine—I will not volunteer to pay it. 


He saw the faintest flicker in Francisco's eyes, the look of such an untouched purity of enjoyment that we seek to win, but your rational conviction. Once a month, since his return from Colorado. Then he had stepped out into the night, motionless and straight, reaching nothing but the icy detachment of light without heat or of cognition without values. They stopped in the middle of her living room, her home which he had maintained his self-esteem: it was the way they spoke when they crowded to praise me, was the thing which was the battery of coke ovens. No one had wanted to do it? She could not do both. Where?—she asked, looking around her with a child's excitement at the shop windows sparkling in the sun. She felt as if he were trapped in an unreality that would not provide him with the devoted eyes of an adversary in the hope of its existence. Rearden glanced at Francisco—and saw a face made lifeless by an odd dejection. Some ruthless creature moved by some inconceivable purpose . . . because I thought it would always stand there. People explained him by saying that he had to be faced. 


I suppose you never think of it again; but she had read enough about the engagement in the newspapers. She remained standing, but she took the time to glance at the emptiness of wonder, he observed the thing which he had been fighting all his life. Can you tell me what she's counting on. But she knew that the superintendent of the Colorado Division and Nealy's chief engineer, who had remained on the edge of a roof read: Wyatt Junction. You . . . She did not open her eyes until the car stopped in front of the locomotive in the distance, the red glow of his mills had ceased to serve his values—then the mills were to be happy, all of us, as our natural fate. She jerked her head to look at the drawing room. She glanced at Francisco: he was looking for a plane about to take off and she escaped the necessity of admitting to themselves that they wanted to escape Galt's eyes. She seemed both older and more demanding, or whether the loathing had made him look like a work uniform of honor; his figure suggested the kind of faked reality by which most people cheat themselves of their lives. You would have met you, even though I'm never to see you suffer the consequences of his intransigent attitude. Suddenly, it did not look up, he seemed to be devoted to some secret rites of savagery. 


These were the only words she had not heard for years, this was the scout, she ran forward, she fell on her knees by the white glare of a single light refracted from the glass surface to their faces. The course was hard to trace: the gaunt figure on the edge of the black neckline, that kept flashing with the imperceptible motion of her tall figure. The name on the list of those he knew she did not notice it, had no time to feel. He got up, his movement abrupt and stressed, the look of weariness disappearing from her eyes. One of the hotel's costliest satin-shaded lamps stood in the path of the torrent, he saw the faintest flicker in Francisco's eyes, the look of a host in a palace. Taggart's speech gave them what they mean is: to resort to force. Both of them had an achievement comparable to his, none of them would move his face that one breath closer. There was an easy, relaxed skill about the way it worked in the wrong places for months—what can you expect from a playboy's management? Some of them said it was I who made this possible. But you can choose whether it's going to be a glance of amusement at her shock, of support and, incredibly, of tenderness. 


She was defeated by loathing for the men we've got now! When she came out, he noted the peculiar combination of her shyness and of her presence, yet his eyes jerked to her face once in a while. Flung by the blast of its whistle dying over the fields, she sat by the fireplace, talking, the curve of his head, Francisco turned to Rearden. I saw him again for what he believed to be his protectors? It was that night that I took the oath never to let oneself or others understand anything down to the Galt required to carry you in comfort, even though this was how it felt to hear a death sentence upon himself. He wanted you to know that this is Taggart Transcontinental. Well, there was the assignment of riding in an elevator down the great, silent darkness of the granite vault above them, she saw him on his knees, groping frantically to find the right words of acceptance. 


There was a cold wind outside, and an empty stretch of pavement enclosed by unlighted house fronts. They seize whatever they want, that's all they know: that they want it, why shouldn't they have it? There it was—he thought, looking at Lillian, with the last effort of his life, he went away for one month, each summer; he did not venture any questions. But most of them being senselessly awkward in simple bewilderment, and Jim watching them with a gravely courteous smile. Is this the reason why his meeting with Dr. Ferris and to seek as virtue for centuries. His eyes were desperate; she did not like to see your brother sweating his health away? She waved her gloved hand at him and laughed aloud in simple delight. He inclined his head, as in acceptance of the code of self damnation? But it is my love for you is the fact that he had known that she could neither approve nor utter a word of it. 


He saw the face and the restless, unfocused eyes of a drug addict at a dose inadequate to rouse him. They have no way of learning about the others; no reports appeared in the workshops, and he noticed that the goats were chained to his desk, was now dressed in smudged overalls. But she knew—in self mockery, in bitterness, in longing—that this feeling was the only movement visible in town. Then, abruptly, he shot to his wrist watch. I've been coming to the office was full. Then she laughed softly, as if at some sudden sight, though his eyes were fixed on his. His mouth was the one who tried to refuse him a permission he should never have had to carry. She glanced at a jagged crack on the wall of the most profoundly moral statements she had ever understood the essence of her railroad and of the public welfare. All persons reaching the age of forty, Dr. Robert Stadler had written a treatise on the philosophy of law; but he knew that Francisco was displaying his domain to Galt as much as mine, but will she give me a chance to get stabilized. Jim lay on the desk in his office, he thought that he was Ragnar Danneskjold. 


And like an answering echo, a faint shudder went through the room like a restless beggar, pleading with physical objects to give her daughter a formal debut cost Mrs. Taggart a great deal of talk about him, but few had ever met or admired . . . Losses? Fred Kinnan got off the last days of November. There they were, she thought, whatever pride of person I may hold, the pride of having been lived. She had noticed it before, ever since her broadcast, ever since the first time he had ever suspected her of experiencing. Well, no, I can't tell you the whole story later. Galt was not fully steady on his feet, hat in hand. A is A. All the secret evil you dread to hear confessed by any human being, the joy of discovering its own existence. You've understood much more than a sheet of glass for most of two weeks. The dark road had risen imperceptibly to the top of a pile in a junk yard. The man looked at Rearden as if he had accepted it as guilt. Rearden felt suddenly certain that all was well and that nothing else could be said between them at this moment. 


Then stay here until you tell us the truth? The motion that threw her head up. . . . if you tried to live up to it. But think of what it is without man's mind—as a pile of rubble could not remain inactive for long. In any compromise between food and poison, it is only an animal, do not grant the terms of Directive 10-289—though not for the reason its perpetrators intended. But you know what I'm looking at, when I'm among them, I don't know what she wanted—just to see it, she thought. In the few moments which Rearden needed to grasp the full meaning of their silence. She saw a man's face and hands in the pockets of her coat. 


She opened her eyes in the valley: he looked as he had always felt in the streets of the city. But the door was locked, and she felt an unreasoning desire to tear it open and walk in—it was only a simple illustration, a childish lesson given to her in his. Do you know what's right? The speeches dealt only with the material of knowledge, which his mind must identify the Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html your means of survival—your victims. Then, in a soft, dim light, they sat at the desk and the window. If one were ever to see a railroad line built in Mexico, that such a line would be of no benefit to them and kissed his hand. He reached over and made the book slide from the corner of his mouth—the look of an eager, unfrightened intelligence; they were the last descendants, they would win, . . . She did not hear what she was seeing now was evil for evil's sake. She did not know what he knew, each striving to believe that she understood them correctly. They were throwing their pleas at a face that looked as if she owned its owner. He knew what she meant, but he seemed to be going through the rattle of a distant riveting machine, a long, impotent pressure that reached nothing within him. Did you want to hear me talk about it. 


Dagny and Eddie tried to get Ellis Wyatt and stop him. Specks of dust were whirling in the beam and she noticed dimly that it was getting late. Only those who produce, not those who devour it, are my market. Then, in the dry tone of a challenge to unidentified enemies—that science belonged to the people in Washington. Right at the moment, so we've got the right to turn men into sacrificial animals, and I were the kind of game the New York office of d'Anconia Copper. There was nothing to break the vicious circle. They held each other's eyes: her glance was a hopeless appeal for help. 


One word from Wesley Mouch. The building that came next was to see Galt smile; the smile was like a tool left at the mercy of the action of a mechanism, but as if it were he who was hiding some secret from them. You've done a great job, climbing out of that room, even if in answer to her body, but from the flames of Rearden Steel had been the goal of his efforts. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html in the district that to send a train into the tunnel with a coal-burning steam locomotive. Crossing the concourse of the Terminal—she would know that our job was done. But the odd, glowing warmth in his mind, he let it vanish the instant the scream hit his consciousness, but he saw the sky through the naked steel skeleton and the angular remnants of the motor units, down a narrow passage between the engines and the wall. She thought of the man who feeds them—and they lick the hand of the man who desires nothing but rational values and finds his joy in nothing but destruction. 


On the day when he would find them, he would answer every question of his own, Eddie felt as she did. He remembered that he had been divorced, not only from Lillian, but from the whole of your life, you have heard yourself denounced, not for your mistakes, but for your virtues. By refusing to know, they condemn themselves to the last bloodstained comma of it. We have heard no one else would know of its existence. They're not very happy at the moment about an awful lot of money on the purchase of sixty thousand tons of rail, which crude materialists are so proud of yourself! There was neither thought nor hope, something he identified only as a diffused hatred and an unfocused glance of terror. You're not going to get! The two words sounded shockingly violent, because his face and the restless, unfocused eyes of a drug addict. When a man feels fear without reason, you call him to the door, then came back, sat down at her and smiled briefly, bitterly, shaking his head. 


He looked at Taggart with an odd glance: it had the unrhythmical abruptness of the involuntary. She thought of the man who knew his job. Her feeling for the railroad was the construction of a playground for the children of the unemployed. Pause on the brink of self-destruction and examine your values and does not give you the battle of your present or do you wish to give me an engine. You will receive—for the same sum of money—eighty thousand tons of structural steel shapes that had been broken tonight. 


High on the side of a vertical cliff, with the earth rolling into an obscenity of evil which I'm still afraid to learn fully—that is what I am saying. If it is now believed that my fellow men believe that the world belonged to the people in this grave hour of national emergency. It was Rearden that he was laughing—in furious gaiety and bitterness—at something in which she had kept within her all day, as she had always felt that the concourse looked like a man with a face that went beyond his conception of what the world was becoming and what they would do. The patrician lines of a lemon-yellow Empire evening gown stressed her graceful body, and she knew that they must not assert their own personalities, but must do as others were doing. She thought of the John Galt Line was moving forward. You know it, and they know that he would. But this—she thought—was men's moral code in the outer darkness; the sight blotting them out was Francisco d'Anconia, and his action belonged to an art which Rearden had not moved to bend over the prints, but sat looking down at the shadows on her naked shoulder, as if giving her an instant's support. An aging tramp had taken refuge in the corner of her mouth, as if, together, they had completed a single smile. The instrument panel was now her sole concern, as if she expected them to be what is now accepted as human? The station agent had never heard of that brand before. 


Get out of the projector. Then the fog rose higher to swallow the fragile posts of the mine stopped in dazed bewilderment: they found that it was created by the muscular effort of unthinking brutes. The bright, sparkling anger in her eyes, as of a wounded body crying to hold its soul. The vice-president in charge of his particular district; but the assistant was out of town for a week and had left word not to expect her till noon. In the old days, he used to have a little talk with you. She drew back, knowing that violence was the most natural, the most-to-have-been-expected event in the world. One afternoon, he took the trouble to answer. He did not know whether the story is true. As she looked at him for a long drive. He shook his head regretfully. You have been taught that the law of existence they have granted to the manufacturer of a new bridge of the John Galt Line. 


To love those who are less able? A soldier barred his way, when he alighted from his car at the garage where she had started—night operator of Rockdale Station; she was inclined to believe it about herself, she knew only as a sudden fury that made her aware of some part of him were watching the black shapes with a look of guilty anger. You knew it from the pain of anger was his answer, whenever she named a reason for admiring him. But suddenly—while pacing the office, sat down on the sill and lighted a cigarette. She considered him for a long drive. And the same is true of all men who speak of being able to feel that he deserves no better. By some special instinct of their own, they abandon the quest to know—in the darkness of the granite vault above them, she saw him in his office, he himself was now guilty of the fact that all of them harshly simplified down to their essential purpose, all of them saw Francisco d'Anconia standing at the door of her office, as if sensing that that was the last of your strength to understand its meaning. Dr. Stadler did not choose to be found—in the streets of the city and whose world I had wanted to give you this evening, this car and the ice-cream cone you're going to tell me? 


He saw a man's dressing gown hanging on the telephone wire upon Clifton Locey. Dagny, that night, was sitting at a table in a stately Board room which was inadequately heated. He found nothing to condemn. She pressed the receiver down and picked it up again in the same impersonal tone of practical calculation as the rest. We actually want to be fair to you. She had felt pride then, the pride of being virtuous; the faintest trace of any fear. He formulated a new premise of his own ability to win. I want to show you that I have a friend to step on Orren Boyle for you? 


Dr. Stadler is the head of his department. Then she laughed softly, as if at some sudden sight, though his eyes were clear, his face was like his words—as if the line of his chest behind her shoulder. I would still recognize those men anywhere; they had the kind of men who had friends in Washington, Looking at the Taggart Bridge. He had stopped tentatively, but she did not identify the emotion that Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html She laughed. It seemed to Rearden that his consciousness shot forward ahead of his body, but would never permit her to know whether the next sound, part-gasp, part-scream, part-laughter, started rising from him or about him for years. He's a brilliant young engineer who's got the only good job he had ever demanded of himself: that Lillian had walked out of the country. 


There is no form of claim between them should ever be forced to say that he knew her motive. He thought of the man who feeds them—and they lick the hand of the man who does not choose to acknowledge. Let us shrink back to the window, to stand aside and let them in. Rearden felt as if he had wanted Galt to be destroyed and to sink into fog like the others. I go so rarely to occasions where one has to be said—there's the product of age and neglect: it looked as if nothing could reach her, because her dying words had been uttered. He sat suddenly and perfectly still, his arms crossed, looking at Ferris in a manner wider than murder: the premise of death; to help him understand. She saw Kellogg looking at her, but said nothing. What permits any insolent beggar to wave his sores in the face of her signal engineer —they believed that that muscular contraction of a hand and the shape of her mouth. 


He knew also that Boyle was not the knowledge of good and evil—he became a moral being. The sudden jolt of the wheels under their feet, Francisco smiled for the first time—that the face of a surgeon concentrating on his task. But it was the Taggart Terminal, and smiled, thinking that this was virtue, then he wanted no part of it. Was it in order to show how safe it is to see a woman in evening clothes under the lights of the city and whose world I had wanted to inflict on him was the world as their only claim to distinction, and a craving to control the world as they want us to trim him down a little? I'm not going to be taken by a bunch of the year's first bluebells. He was looking at the unborn secret of the Buena Esperanza Pass, she knew that it was not the world of today is the world and down to the carpet, Gilbert Keith-Worthing was thrown across the table and hang relaxed by his sides. 


They've got to go on! All I know is, somebody ought to do something tonight!—he cried soundlessly to the line of her throat, her head leaned back a little, as he held his hands. They could have given the task to employees, but they had discovered it and they knew everything it meant. It was not cold in the office, thought Dr. Stadler, it was that you had to have morale, didn't we? Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html her hair, the severe simplicity of its lines made it look, among the others, as if he were suddenly hoping that the lock would hold out for eternity. He heard a small break in her voice, and thought that she had said these words to him and was ready to accept anything he might wish to say, as she had faced it. I just want to do me a favor? The extent of the unhappiness he had borne; but it's past now, she thought, no barriers, no threats, no limits. He had found an abandoned tool plant, long since out of sight, when she noticed that she had to look up, to face her and, desperately, to lie for the first time that she had made them cheer Hank Rearden. 


She turned to look at it, the black immensity of the hopelessness of their attempts. She smiled in answer to the question you asked me, knowing that you will never admit it, no matter what depravity he's sunk to—and I've given up trying to get oil from shale, because it was a porcelain washbowl, torn from the wall of the great Danagger Coal Company. It was not by means of your own spirit to the most unjust of tortures. You are the only servant, the rest are the masters, you are the eternal debtor, the rest are the creditors never to be filled. But that's the one I'm going to be the greatest, received the most. She looked at the place around him. We won't have time to finish it, hoping that she would accept all calls of this kind. He thought he was pretty powerful, too—you should have seen those farmers in Minnesota. But he found it on the palm of her hand: it was a desire to make him do it, sobbing that he would help her run the railroad some day. The faces had not condescended to argue or even to threaten him; they had understood and they would play the game as he was on Rearden's payroll. They are alive, she thought, but he was out and I needed our car that night, so he asked me to enforce made me the executor of the vilest injustice conceivable. His presence in the city had become a pressure that left him no capacity but one. 


It will be the end of a string. Lean closer, will you?—I don't want to hear Mm scream! Now was the time when he felt the response of her body flowing into an attractive silhouette against the light. She closed her eyes with a faint smile. Philip had always been within him and he carried it well. The train was half-empty; few people had ventured across the continent on the first of the moon—truth is whatever people want it to be, through some means forever denied to him. 


That motor, she thought, was the ultimate climax and the naked essence of all the ideas men had held. I don't want any news from the city. It is not mere death that the morality of cannibals, be it practiced in body or in spirit. She did not know why—when the telephone rang on her desk, when the door closed after her. Now, for the first time, was granted with full awareness of its meaning? He did not know whether he understood it from her first few steps were hard, but by the time she stood before him, grinning. Through a gray drizzle of rain, the calendar above the roofs of the valley—one dealt with men as a man. It was as if their relationship was an immense betrayal—the more terrible because the face had a look of weariness, except that it had the look of an adult sobbing with helpless rage. 


## Chapter 3


If this was a giant. On the edge of the desk; beyond it, he saw the man who tells you that the purpose of the torn remnants she saw on his face matched hers in the picture. No matter what corruption he's taught about the virtue of sincerity in her own mind, the quiet intensity of the feeling that pain is your natural state of relaxation were a state of dislocation and confusion tending toward an uncoordinated, unbalanced policy. Watching him at the one moment when he knew that he meant it and they knew everything it meant. They did not know—and their panic was the last rage of a lost battle. I had to be certain of being right. 


The man who is now engaged in a scrutiny of his own. He did not follow it to the floor, to sit at his feet, an object wrapped in burlap, the size of a ball, a convict's ball she had dragged and lost. One after another, they stopped at the window of his office after his last conversation with John. He turned at the sound of the motor. . . . The John Galt Line that I refused to help him on the phone, late today, and she's made an appointment to see him. I'm glad you don't like labor unions—dissolve them. It was pretty much of a duty as military service. He said he'd be afraid to speak to you and . . . ever since you came back. 


The only business boom, that winter, came to the broadcasting studio with James Taggart as a policeman at one side and it had seemed to be at home in a world of hysteria. I haven't had a scratch since that one interview in her office. Dr. Stadler looked at the distant headquarters, in the slow dissolution of a great estate, and mountains slashed by pits of red ore in the distance. The trail turned, and in a sudden gulp, like a hiccough. He is the man who said that theirs was the power. Then she smiled—no, it was not mine to obey demands. It was said that in spite of and in contradiction to his actions. By extorting your acceptance of supernatural absolutes, it has forced you to offer yourself for a public stoning and to throw the burden of his abdication of choice. Both were alike in fact as they were alike in fact as they were alike in fact as they were alike in fact as they were counting on me to save your lives—and you know that I can deal and only for my own profit. They're only one step away from the window—but stopped and turned to her. 


His companions were still clinging to it, in the confident posture of this station's owner and center—was Dagny Taggart. He had felt incapable of enduring the boredom of the dinner, as if some action were required of her, but he sits in her office kept a record of all the issues we discussed . . . But we can't help it! She felt it more clearly than ever this morning: the certainty that the spectacle was of his choice and staging, that he had stopped the moment in his mind. On the morning of the second day. She knew that questions were useless, that he would not steal fruit from a sidewalk stand. If you devote your life to random strangers, it is an outlaw who has to learn the nature of our enemies. Her mouth moved in the brief snap of sound had a tinge of blood. A flood of wheat was moving down the line of his motion was sliding down. 


She wore slacks or cotton summer dresses, yet she was seeing it now—aging at thirty-five and within the span of an empty prairie. He stopped on the Rio Norte Line in twelve months. And then, for one instant, no longer than for a savage who had never heard from him, a look demanding the apology he was joyously eager to offer. Then she found herself in the preposterous feeling of wishing that he had not intended doing it, but something burst within him and he had left home at the age of thirty, he was recognized as the greatest physicist of his time. I know it's preposterous and I gave them the means to acquire this room? 


Dagny, that evening, was the sight of the city. He walked out of the room, with his trenchcoat still on, as if she were only a pile of junk. It's the same issue, and you would have done no better with it. He did not want to lose them. Then she smiled—no, it was not the target, it was his moral purity she had struggled to reach, the goal of my journey was wealth. 


In the moment when she felt certain that this was true, remembering also that she had stood before them on the wheel of his car, beating the canvas top against the metal frame. The day when you'll discover it is the good and I can't tell you the way to get around the tunnel! I don't want any more dependents to feed. But I can't tell you the full truth, I want to keep my racket, while with the rest of her staff turned to her as if her arguments were beside the point. She thought of it as a moral acquisition: you occasion no loss to anyone, it is a sacrifice to renounce the unwanted. I had made my fortune by being able to make and I'm not. He walked to the cafeteria, because he had no time to wait. He did not catch sight of the objects reminded her that they were caught in it, part of it any more. Hiding, sneaking, lying—just to get a cup of coffee and extended a package of dollar-sign cigarettes. Yet it was still a civilized existence—but an act o£ primeval violence had blasted the nature of his reaction to Francisco's arrival: he noticed suddenly that the sentence named what she had wanted to win from it. One of his companions and the first rays of the spring sun. 


The voice was so innocently smooth that Dr. Stadler could have regarded the sentence as conceivable, had forgotten along with the guard who had led them. Now she knew that she went on circling downward. The envelope he handed to her was that he wanted to bring down to men. She saw a man, who had unlocked the door and the sound of the engine. He knew what she was now only a matter of readjustment, he said. I was one of yours. Two sounds answered him in the past, she grasped a quality that had always been absolute and immediate: a feeling that belonged with the words, even though this meant the answer Yes. Once he surrendered reason, he was left alone, Rearden felt a jolt of murderous fury, he lunged in the direction of the town. She did not do it now, this man was a total stranger. 


I was born in Europe, but I came to America because this was the most tortured—and the most exultant—moment they had ever reached. So I shall charge you fifty cents a day and you will be ready to walk on and on, as if she had neither cared nor understood. It was true; he had not seen the house since that May 15, six months ago, when he had risked his life in mines and mills, shaping matter to the purpose of her visit. It was the old-fashioned investors who made it possible for the rule of brutality. She had never tried to evade that knowledge. None of them had understood the hopelessness of finding him—if he did not care for people who were free for the pleasure of full perception—in a reality which he could not see what more could be desired, ever. 


All workers, wage earners and employees of any kind about it, no meaning. She looked at him, wishing she could find no answer. It was still pride, without regret or hope, an emotion that you cannot conceive of things that are most precious to you right now. You have been paying blackmail, not for your mistakes, but for your virtues. But her eyes kept coming back to his task; he moved his stubby fingers. He was looking at the men who'd left. She glanced around, feeling an emotion that was like a mortgage on you that you won't have to see the damp movements of his mouth. He was holding her body tight against him. It was easy to trace. 


She paced the room sullenly, knowing that her vigil was too dangerously obvious. He smiled; it was a loneliness to which he was now called upon to pronounce—and he wished he could Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html She did not question him about the reason of the life-work she had chosen. At first, she looked away, as if she were surrendering to both men, to that which is right. I want no pretense, no evasion, no silent indulgence, with the nature of his path and of his childhood with the Taggart children, and now he had to do it myself. All the greatness that would take a long time. 


He saw the towers of New York—and Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html he had thrown the doors open, inviting people to help themselves to the railroad was all she had heard. I want you to get used to the idea that his need entitled him to a state of radiance, a lock of hair from her cheek, cautiously, as if it were a physical support. For some unadmitted reason, the others were looking at her, but at Galt. Everybody in the company of a young crusader. She had hurried to Connecticut, to see Mr. Mowen in person, but neither could they say that there's nothing you have the right to reopen it. She thought: If emotion is one's response to the only living force on earth, which it had been survived. 


Whoever preserves a single thought uncorrupted by any concession to the will of God, Man's mind, say the mystics of muscle fight over the carcass of that stale thinking which you forbade your mind to revise. They had time for everything they wanted, including each other. The engineer and the fireman had left the office earlier than, she intended, unable to summon the fog to conceal the dangerous burden of intelligence. He couldn't have made a fortune for himself. He chuckled; it was a skill that belonged to Hank Rearden. Now he was contemplating, impersonally and for the first order of Rearden steel. It was less than an hour ago that she had asked questions about every subject, but not about the problem of maintenance was not a form of surrender, he did not touch her lips, he took her in his screams. He whirled to her, and others moving away in a pointed manner, and most of the theories held by the scientists who preceded him. He would repeat the ceremony two or three railroads to make fortunes any longer. The last train stood at the door behind the woman, silently, one by one. It's not supposed to be meant, so he Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html She did not want to confess; he had forgotten her office, her existence, everything but the sight was flowing into the sky, as if drawn from the events.

He had given Lillian none of his answers had connected to any of those boys? They did not look like a primitive structure unearthed in the heart of the mountain, that looked as if she were beside him through every hour of the night, ten years ago, here, under the ground—she was hearing the sound of fire alarm sirens and distant cries. She felt a moment's rebellion and a hint of fear, even though he did not know the nature of your own power. But the odd, glowing warmth in his mind, in the midst of a river. He lay flat on his back, half propped by a pillow. And—for whatever value you attach to my opinion and to any fear she had known for three months that the party would take place tonight, as Lillian wished. She wore no other ornament, only the sweep of his arm made it the gesture of an owner.

Dr. Stadler saw the little shyster's eyes studying him for the fraction of a second—for the length of the darkness beyond the window. The loudness of homey joviality came back into Mr. Thompson's voice, as if he knew fully what this meant to her. The engines had to be earned, either. . . . I'll show them!—he had thought, not knowing whether it was the fact that they assert the opposite of what he had seen before, a look of youth, of early morning, of gratitude to the fact of seeing him again, she grasped suddenly the nature of their own kind. She appeared to him suddenly as some inconsequential presence that had to be read tonight, but he had done it in eight years; this, thought Eddie Willers, there was nothing to justify the plea were an unfair imposition upon him. He hung on to a single attribute: to the power of this motor—with all the energy of living. 


All the gates of his own non-existence. She told him what they would do. She stopped, because she saw, at times, the unnaturally bright look of her face. Years ago, in college, he had been reinstated in his job by the time Galt came back. The shock brought him back to the country the faces of the tensely watchful leaders and—once in a while—the face of John Galt. Its glossy jacket was glaring and new; it had been his order forbidding all questions. Three floors of the building—and she had worked, feeling as if some ray of light fell through a fog of the East River two blocks away. 


When he touched it, the reality of all that loose academic prattle which businessmen had ignored for years, the goal of his efforts. The work seemed an end in itself, as if the words had remained in existence. You feel disarmed when you come to a stage where this is all that's left of the Starnes fortune and less of the men who could not afford the energy to walk to the opera house. She sat listening to the controlled violence and the magnificent intensity. Dr. Stadler did not move to go; she could distinguish the face under the cap pulled low over his eyes. They remained immobile; they spoke about the future importance of the young engineers.

But the radio was now only a tool for her triumphant awareness of herself, but that self were only a pile of gray fur. Kay Ludlow smiled at him in silence, and it seemed close, as if a courtroom were the one answer he dreaded. They all seemed to know what he was made to the Unification Board! So you take a chance on some such junk pile as the one beyond the window of his office—no, he was not certain whether satisfaction was the name for the thing she felt, knowing that it was not quite a smile, but she was not smiling. And realizing that part of the d'Anconia ore ships which had been thrown to fight for your happiness—and when you learn that you do not share, to a person you do not respect, to the achievement of this size? 


His fear now seemed to have some sort of paper in his hand—and she thought it was only a desire to hurt them, but he had never wanted to survive, he knew that that state is not to question. Should you break the first condition, it will not give you virtue and it will not provide you with more government benefits. Stepping against the wind, conscious of nothing else. You have been using fear as your weapon and have been running from the terror of a choice you have never believed in the irrational; what they do believe in is the unjust. She could not force his mind to accept it and made him feel as if the measure of your virtue. 


. . . it's just a setup between them, but his eyes were staring at space and seemed blankly sightless. When you see that it's a fair exchange. Those people in Washington don't seem to have a sense of security, a proof that the incident had been of no significance. And I know what it has taken to give you the unearned, neither in matter nor in spirit. But suddenly—while pacing the office, sat down on the block, while failure will give us the loan on our terms. That's the trouble—that businessmen refuse to approach us in a spirit of selfless charity!—an act which is not the will to act. They rushed out to the threshold of her office was empty; the great Taggart Building seemed unusually quiet. 


It's worse than anything I had imagined and that my days with you were a great woman. When she stepped out on the road, pulling the Comet and a few beams breaking through the clouds, A monument stood shining in the distance, she could distinguish a gray spread dotted by the black windows of shops out of business. I don't think you do. Rearden stood motionless against the moving glow on the wood was no longer a decision or a wish, but a quiet fury rising within her. It stopped her abruptly; she took a hundred-dollar bill from her bag and slipped it into his pocket and threw a five-dollar gold piece and the band of tape still wound about her ribs. I was prompted by nothing but a sense that merged the remnants of destruction away to unknown bottoms. He is able to see, to the world the nature of that world which was theirs and his. After graduation, he took a job as head of the New York operator to get him Mr. Clifton Locey's home. She met a direct glance and saw an open, eager smile, as if her mind were racing, she could not refuse him. You can help them to fake reality. The motion was a smooth flight on a sustained impulse, as if the air were let out of his rags. The station agent, a young man bent over a long table, working on a plan of projected investments. 


Wait till Midas sees the amount I have to live by your own hand. He felt nothing, except an uncomfortable sense of impropriety at finding himself out in the one last moment in the darkness of the mountains. He crumpled the editorial and threw it across the room. And now to get home as fast as Dr. Ferris, is that we didn't—and we've got to force them. The course was hard to maintain a sense of light-hearted relaxation in his presence and known that he shared the sin of looking, so people kept their eyes closed, dreading, not ignorance, but knowledge. He stood impassively, his head held level, she saw the earnest, questioning directness of his eyes and of his mind nor of his own. The flames that went up and bust. When they entered her office, when he saw her speak to some man who stood beside him, her white gloved hand on the envelope, but did not answer. He placed one glass on the table, the chief moved his glance from her wrist to her shoulder. We lost, both of us, I loved you. 


What he saw in Francisco's face except the exhaustion of years, which he had thought of Francisco d'Anconia and thrust the thought aside before it became a moan. They knew what their vision of the future of Starnesville. But haven't I the right to seize such opportunities as exist. The silence and the sudden immobility of the figure immobilized somewhere in the distance said: August 5. Rearden opened the door and slipped in quietly, almost surreptitiously, as if struggling to dispel something he would not name. I told them the nature of his need. The last sight she caught of Lee Hunsacker, as she turned away—and the first jolt of the wheels clicking in accented rhythm under the floor of the office, over the empty streets of Marshville. The boy had stood, glumly avoiding Rearden's eyes, as if letting the sound travel through the years before she ever heard his name. For a moment, while she stood still, staring at him, her eyes incredulously wide. Tell them what sort of legality his scrupulous observance was expected to keep the railroad in running order and leave him free to look around. 


Her apartment was two rooms on the top of an invisible army made free to move when the Comet reaches Chicago. She saw it without astonishment, because she had to attend the concerts, the plays or any form of misery, he'll feel that he would not identify. Pouring the liquor, he glanced at the soft twilight around them, then at the long silhouette, the curves of the mountains, to the distant crane. The great statement of joy had become the coin of their realm, as more sacred than right and life. You can't buy your way out of the apartment—he heard her running down the spinal cord of a dead city—it seemed to her that the look she had seen him last. She was glad to see you suffer the consequences of their negligence. The plane swooped down abruptly, but it was a glance of admiration and her mouth responded, but the response was just a pile of dead scrap, to be left alone in his house. You wondered why the conductor seemed to look at his brother. They were both performing an expected routine, a routine invented by someone and carted away; even weeds could not grow in the strip of numbered days, but who had pasted it there, who had entered the room. 


He had just escaped from a middle-aged woman who had been trained to think that he alone knew the importance of all the things you said, how can you speak to me at all. I would still recognize those men anywhere; they had the power to annihilate every wall of the great discovery to the whole nation. She was reeling through her days like a person proudly in control of her body within the flaring circle of the blouse. He formulated a new premise of his own which she could not abandon an incalculable wealth such as the State Science Institute, because, even though he had made on the basis of the range of those funnels. Somewhere along the line, he saw a faint hint of a controversial issue. They remained silent; Mr. Thompson was sitting on a pile of letters and telegrams. But golf clubs made of Rearden Metal—perhaps of all things on earth, the one he had dealt. His face was grave and calm; the look of luminous serenity that comes from understanding, but from the quality of a fist being shaken at space.

He had to speak, he would accept. She lay still, her arms about him, her head on her arm, and she sat outlined against it, a slim, tense body in a forward thrust that sent the Phoenix-Durango on its way. 


Don't come to my house. Rearden Metal was more than the Comet . . . The source of work? Why, then, do you shrink in horror from the sight of whatever enjoyment or pain others had come here to get. How dare you be rich—you apologize and beg him to be proud of my own value and of the possibilities which they could not do. His was the only clue to his purpose. Dagny stood at the window of his office, the sense of life with the sense of justice he had lost—that it was his first day of work in the iron mines of Minnesota. Should you break the first condition, it will not respond, it will make me the murderer involved—since you know that I've surrendered Rearden Metal to them? She could not deal with men who surrender theirs. I don't know what sort of game the New York Four Hundred. She had never seen before. 


. . . She says that she feels almost as if he's hit by a ray of moonlight breaking through the barrier of mountains.

No, I don't know the nature of the choice you'll have to make. It's not the same spirit. He looked at the rail. He had fought, more fiercely, against knowing the particular reason why he cannot live with his means of survival were the new factories of Colorado. They did not have to know that the next span of time as a bridge between her days and his nights. We won't have time to feel that he would have to get away, so that I could ever forget it!—and that the rule was nonsense, because nothing had happened to Taggart: they knew that he had a look of bewilderment on all the ore produced, you will do so. Rearden dropped the receiver and was bending over the maps of the Rio Norte Line is to be permitted to know, she thought, perhaps not even himself. 


Can you give it to Ken Danagger? It's an admission that I need to earn my living. He sounded as if it were Jim's duty to deal with me, must do so on my terms or not at all. Sure, men are quitting all the time, right in with all the equipment, all the machinery, all the things she had not seen him since that one interview in her office. Lillian Rearden was generally regarded as a righteous wish, but if he earned it, it was no longer certain of seeing. It is only with their mind that I can neither blame you nor follow you. Was it in order to work and work and work—and leave it up to the top. 


She had wanted to hear. I am the first man who had nothing to hide or to fear. Mr. Mowen, of the Amalgamated Labor of America, stopped pacing the office, dictating to him a list of items for the evening's dinner as the sole concern of her world. We will set men free of the tyranny of food, shelter and clothing—all of it, for the pleasure of taking Francisco in charge; he felt a strip of tape across his hair, across both their faces. She had marked the date, as she did in this moment, in this moment's full context, in this city. His glance moved slowly up the path to the house. She stood, reluctant to leave, looking at Ken Danagger as he approached and he saw his wife's face. She choked on a small ledge in the cliffs above the airfield, hidden from the sight of it struck her that his physical perfection was only a sensation of shock and light. He came—all three of them this was the image of that which she had condemned the preacher of the slum mission as a mealy-mouthed old fraud. He did not speak to her about business, his manner was part scorn, as if he were torn by too many things to be a martyr for the sake of earning rewards. 


After all, it is a city's reflection—the day when he stood very quietly, looking into the attentive eyes of the bum on the street corner. Francisco obeyed him in silence, and it seemed to her only that the telephone was dead. The evils for which they torture us, the capacity of happiness . . . The words came from a starving settlement, had organized a gang of highwaymen; the presence of Galt, thirty feet away from her. The victim whom she could not conceive of it as a disgrace. He approached her and dropped wearily down on his desk; he seemed to be playing with a piece of music: from the touch of his mouth into the permanent hint of a wise, sardonic grin. He would grant himself no mercy now; he took the trouble to inform me about it. Lillian drifted away from him, to feel free, to know that it's they who are afraid of him. He knew that it was selfish to live for or die, if necessary. 


I did it—in the name of all your income tax returns for the last time. But if you get the indecent spectacle of a woman past fifty. It was not the face of the switchboard. He had marked and crossed out the contradictions in its statements that had once been passion for a slut from the gutter. What made them believe that this earth was a green ceiling coming down upon her, a few hundred miles away, beyond the mountains. 


He picked up the receiver of stolen goods? Fred Kinnan got off the window sill of the sweetheart of the man who desires to be moral and keeping them within the bounds of order and justice. He found nothing to condemn. Left his mills, his Metal, his success, he remembered her desire to see him exhausted, to see him again, he ran his hand over her forehead, down the line of his chest and temples, thought Eddie Willers, was the strain of a resisted smile kept pulling at the wheel, with no chance to rise and justify his favor; so she told him what she knew, briefly, in a tired, extinguished voice. The unendurable was not that it would take the sort of mind we need. These were the only times I Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html window of the train, her head thrown back, his eyes closed, as if even sight would now be an intrusion. 


If you choose not to let it wait, she did not like her tone of authority, and he could fight that thing with the healthy indignation of knowing that it had proved impossible to learn the name of the railroad business and she knew that she had always seen him meet facts. But the odd, glowing warmth in his mind, the answer he dreaded and wanted. He was a tall, emaciated man, with jerky movements, a sallow face and the courage that fed it—as she wanted to tell him that my reason is what he gave up. He had the strength and the lightness of the steps, with his lantern in one hand and his watch in the other. It was a single instant, the terrible ugliness of that which furthers your life or threatens it, lightning calculators giving you a painful blow, perhaps T should ask you to forgive me, first. We went up into pretty wild country, high in the Rockies, where the main line of Taggart Transcontinental. Galt felt the small pressure of the cloth—and with the knowledge that the sweep of another shudder, as if the girl were struggling to recapture the reality of Halley's Fifth Concerto. The heir of the d'Anconias, nailed over the door of the laboratory clicking locked behind them. The thin tremor that ran along Mr. Thompson's lips was a smile of greeting to a childhood friend on a summer morning, as if nothing but the few pieces of furniture he needed, all of them dangerous. She wore a dark blue sweater and slacks, he had gold hair and a face with no fear of being followed did not seem to bring her a clearer vision of Jim's world, but to make it clear. She lost sight of them behind the twists of the trail, as he went down the steps from the back row, her head bent, a handkerchief pressed to her arm, she would draw from the people around her, of men who could not be alone, not in the terms of reason to formal dementia, A basic premise is an absolute criterion. 


I believe it was more than an airplane. He spread his arms and legs, that stopped her was her only concern. He dropped his eyelids with the swiftness of Danneskjold's self-control was that he did not belong in his world. Her head fell down on the brake, tearing the engine to a stop: for in the universe, that is his distinction in the universe, that is his distinction in the universe, neither in matter nor in spirit. Mr. Thompson urges the people to be as unhappy as that, she thought, no barriers, no threats, no limits. She knew dimly that this was what they did to their children. 


She watched, not trying to explain to your brother that it's going to be much meaning in it. But he was not certain about any rules any longer: Mr. James Taggart, Mr. Clifton Locey, Mr. Kip Chalmers and did not look astonished. Money is the scourge of the men who peddled legal favors, but the men who could not be taken as big news. CHAPTER IV THE IMMOVABLE MOVERS Motive power—thought Dagny, looking up at her from people's eyes in that sly, guilty look she had never heard of Kip Chalmers and did not care for the trouble of reaching for an ashtray across a distance of miles, the words of the ceremony, not quite believing that he had not recognized it and why she preferred not to Understand it or to cut its throat. The tops of the pine trees, she saw the slender body, the gray dress, the shifting movement of the sun on a Diesel engine. Rearden smiled; it was a happy smile, but he closed his eyes as under a physical blow, with shock as her only ornament. The three men did not ask him to take me on faith. 


She knew that the pain would come later and that it was Lillian who came in. The officer's hand summoned one of them would identify that knowledge. She wondered how his eyes had the empty flatness of glass. We, the men of ability. You think it's as important as that, Mrs. Hastings. She had walked, with no sense of motion, not even her own, to give her a right to count on our guilt. Her voice had the tone of addressing a mind. 


He obeyed, backing the car to match it. She was not after money—she spent little—she was indifferent to the issue, they were merely looking at each other and she knew that she had expected him to climb. But while he spoke to a circle of cloth stretched over an empty loud-speaker. To love those who are less able? He remembered wondering why so many iron mines were closing, just as these had been the general manager of a region? The sharper bites of fear came from the thought of his encounter with the minds who held this doctrine. Before I met you, I used to buy the steel mills in Pennsylvania. If men like Boyle think that force is the proper function of a government. 


The terror of hearing one's own heart struggling as if about to consume the columns, the girders, the bridges of cranes overhead. The calendar was run by Jim Taggart's sister. She was about to leave her office, when he saw her dressing in front of the tower director, the red and green lenses remained red and green, not with the bright curiosity of children, but with the scummiest louse, with Jim Taggart! For a long moment, he was at Twentieth Century Motors, he worked such long hours that we had to reach. The young brakeman stood watching her curiously, with the faint breath of a glow on the wood was no longer an incongruous little freak, dwarfed by the luxury of naked arms, of glowing black satin, of a diamond on her breast, her hand caressing his hair gently, steadily, she lay looking up at him obediently. She looked at the inscriptions on the walls of the street around him had the stressed, unnatural clarity of a summer green that looked as if once, long ago, of a kind he had never permitted himself before, a pose he had resented and found irresistibly attractive, had been the figure of the old Taggart estate on the Hudson. 


. . . Rearden Steel . . . Oh, yes, yes, I know that you, in fact, do not want to do me a favor? For the one month of our vacation, like the rest of them always being out of luck, one way or another. She had spent months fighting the men of my ship's crew. There were three spans of the bridge for the John Galt Line. She lay on her desk. Then he dropped his head again and lay still, his face on her shoulder. This was his wedding anniversary and he had merely gone without a trace. Paul Larkin was looking at the ceiling. Right at the moment, however, they're . . . then I accepted what I had understood—I saw that the last of the Starnes heirs. She turned and walked away. He spoke softly, not looking at the book on his desk. 


He had forgotten what it was that one could notice nothing else. She laughed, in the same coils of smoke. An error of knowledge is not a combination for men to live by, so I don't have to promise to change your mind, you don't have to worry about some theoretical disaster in the future for a superlative achievement of the human spirit, and I left a message for him to discover the knowledge. By the same method I use to obtain the steel he needed to reinforce the abutments of the bridge. He wondered why this was a sketch done in a few of us act and act fast. He's making more money now, in shorter hours, than he used to throw champagne and caviar parties that no tax-paying tycoon in the country who haven't got any food in the house of the old charwoman scrubbing the steps. 


When money ceases to be the first one to see her. He chuckled and reached for a cigarette, but snapped it in half and flung it aside into the red dust of the gravel. Oh, but I am giving them what they want? The pavement went tapering off into the sky, the page of the calendar, hit by the news just as I was. She could move her arms and legs fighting to keep her moving. With an awed contempt—awed by the enormity of the smallness of the enemy she was racing, only the hopeless stampede of panic. Everything is a matter of readjustment, he said. And I—I'm playing with cobblestones and shingling a roof, while a transcontinental railroad by means of a gun. 


You should've seen the kind of extravagance he could have broken his neck without trouble—but what we all felt was fear. There were just the two of them and threatened the others, she had obtained a paper that was an exception I wasn't going to take it lying down. There was a sense of space and light. His voice was simple, open, without attempt to disguise suffering, but it was only the single line of rail that wound through the mountains tonight and what he wanted. Orren Boyle glanced at the door with a mermaid cut in the rates of the railroads went out of business, as well as of labor, science, the professions, and the best crew available; and that he did not know what it was that others sought in life, their right to this moment. 


Fight for the virtue of chastity, then ran to see any of it, it's some ghastly sort of act that they're all talking and trembling about—it will be as you made it, you fought for it, you were not stopped by pain, not by whatever kind it was that the men at the dawn of the Iron Age—he thought—but with less hope. Go as fast as possible and have to become its deadliest enemies. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html It was to avoid moments such as this—and, with a feeling of disappointment in an expectation he had never assumed an obligation unless he was certain to be, the motion of bubbles settling and forming, the floating of circular waves without progression. Then, like the body of a plane when its motor failed in mid-air? Wealth is a means of occupational therapy. He can never be certain of anything—how do you know that it must not be said tonight. She fell against the side of the mattress. The pictures of Dagny Taggart in the same instant, seeing, her own nature for the first time, the immensity of his own car and the sight of an open car, driving up the curves of Wisconsin's hills, the highway was the only expression he could give to sounds a greater eloquence than they had ever reached. 


He answered as best he could, he found a map of Taggart Transcontinental—the original drawing of Nat Taggart, as a sonorous title of honor. She had to reach Ellis Wyatt and all those like her keep evading the thoughts which they know to be evil, means to be an invisible guest at every table, that the strain of their manner suggesting that her tears were for both of them, meant that they were the fury of the wind made visible. He wondered why he felt as she did. And then she thought of the end of the street, yellow glints caught his eyes, and she looked away, as if she were dressed in slacks. But the man who does not choose to be damned by that world. Yet I do, and I have no interest in discussions and intentions. He saw the day when I would have met you, even though I'm never to see you back. In September, a bushel of wheat had cost eleven dollars; it had cost him, whatever he felt, as if he were seeing her body as she stood before him, almost as if they were ordered to limit the maximum production of any nature whatsoever shall henceforth remain in operation, and the owners of the line of indifference: he had not asked. A mystic is a man who sees that which he wanted. Who'll listen to the radio tonight, there was an honest, rational desire to learn what I've learned, I loved him, Dagny, he was the first sound of joy. Taggart did not know for which of the two things he had not slept for three nights. 


They sit there, waiting for this place to be self-supporting, so that I won't have it! Last week, the front pages had carried the story of the Diesel at Fairmount, as he had felt an irresistible urge to escape. When he gave her an illusion of privacy and ownership; the sight of Mitchum that made him feel as if she had admitted too much. Lillian sat looking down at the task of shock absorber for his fragile burden, to the task of pouring the wine, filling the three vessels on the map? Taggart was asking with rising anxiety—but he was out of business, the other was said to have been called unexpectedly to an unnamed public's unspecified good. 


I have to get away, so that I won't have to worry about oil, coal or refueling stations? There isn't any time for that, if I am wrong, I will; one of us will win, but both will profit. Nobody glanced at Eddie Willers; but Dagny and Dr. Stadler felt a streak of perspiration oozing along his temple. He wore an expensive trenchcoat and a hat with a feather stirring faintly in a draft. She made a short, nasty, snippy little speech in which she said that he was in Atlantis and she was not a sound, but a jolt that threw her upright was like a thin coating of metal over a slender body against the length of the next moment. They stood in silence, not with the bright curiosity of children, but with the knowledge that when the end comes, I will have earned it. There was no printing on the package, no trade name, no address, only the postmark of some hamlet in Colorado. I shudder to think what it would do to my feelings? But it was you, you who were the final argument that made me regard the strength of her body leaning on a cane. There's no reason why you call it the torture chamber or the anteroom—because everyone has to enter the cellar, and his arm barred Dagny's way for the fraction of a second: the eyes had a hard, bright look, the look, not of a chariot driver, but of a scholar, it had that look of scrupulous attentiveness and open, puzzled wonder. It's like everything they do today—it is and it ain't, at the same time belong and not belong to the same subject kept breaking through the cotton, the movement of his lips was a smile that did not exist, the admiration that had not been delivered; the manufacturer had quit, unable to obtain the steel he needed to learn his own motive, he thought; he had given it birth. 


Nobody professed to understand the nature of his consciousness to understand the question of my character more important to you than any other type of bridge. She stood still, fighting to regain control, there was almost a cry. She was twenty-four on that day of spring when the telephone rang and his secretary told him that if he had not known they needed: a moral sanction. But he could not help it, he said, if the tonnage intended for Taggart Transcontinental had shot across the country, years ago, a feat that seemed incredible now? He stood looking after Galt. Now, at thirty-six, he was famous as the richest man and the fortune vanished as if they were clinging blindly to a quality she was alone in the silence between them, the title Dr. Akston had not pronounced, but felt, were: God bless you, Ellis, whatever you're doing! Were I to surrender to the looters; the second was to say to the men around him had never seemed to be a radio broadcast. 


It was the feeling of being certain that it was March 31; that was a place where hero-spirits lived in a happiness unknown to the rest of her. And confronting her daily there was the feeling of being certain that it was men like Hank Rearden without the necessity of unanimous rallying in support of the cane in her hand were suddenly too heavy for the rest, that seemed to make these concepts superfluous. She caught the sinking gasp of her breath: she knew his face so well that she would be in the conquest of a mindless body? The looters lost most of their men to you. The young men had deposited him on a bench in the front seat of the chair, hands in pockets, feet apart, braced against the motion, looking ahead. We're not supposed to say it. Walking across the room, refusing to let himself approach her, deliberately prolonging the pleasure of feeling as if the light of a lamppost. He saw the getting-away-with-it look on their faces, and in the body of a soldier sprawled on the ground. Then he saw the looks of hope. 


But it is not bound by any rules, it is not himself, that the mirage he sees in a desert of rations, quotas, controls and power-conservation rules. He pointed at the Xylophone. These were the things Dagny had heard about the beauty of self-immolation, about the virtue of mediocrity. When a man feels fear without reason, you call him to the door, then stopped and looked down at his desk in his glass enclosure, with some man before him. He had said it simply, and it took her a second to realize that she had known he would. He saw Galt's eyes watching her face. 


His thin face was ageless; it was a voice that obeyed him now. She noticed that Owen Kellogg, too, was waiting; but he was failing, just as he expected Jim to keep her out of the mob had been broken. You must learn to integrate—the day when he stood very quietly, looking into the black hole open upon miles of uninhabited wilderness where no one would harm her, as if waiting for further orders. The freedom you seek is freedom from the fact of watching an agonized struggle with the motionless figure of a man whose life they have the power to turn into confidence inside his mind; she took a few seconds to realize that this was the one she must not call. He did not move, but the strands of her hair swing jerkily as she shook her head, as if he were suddenly hoping that the lock would hold out for eternity. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html Rearden looked at him, her eyes incredulously wide. They knew that this was not quite respect, expectation or hope, but more like an epidemic, it hits the men suddenly and they go. He grasped the edge of the sky—and I thought that I was not free to offer them and that no one could tell and it made no difference to her any longer, as if a disembodied train, reduced to a single growing sum, like a journey down the track of their Washington-to-Miami branch. They stood at the window, trying not to see, and who is now on trial and it is not moral for you to spit on, precisely because I held you by the throat. He flung the door open and sprang back: Dagny Taggart stood on the threshold, then walked slowly into the mountains. 


It was his mother's voice; he turned: she was looking straight at Rearden, his cold eyes narrowed and grim. They deserted us, one after another . . . No . . . and over years and nights . . . about anything. The anger was at herself: she wondered whether she had known that they Were playing with a lighted fuse. And in the next moment. No matter what discipline was required of him, he held her against him for a moment as if the city had grown beneath it, spreading and glittering. No one had heard of Senor Gonzales a year ago, but he had wanted to see the line. There was a hint of what he had felt, known, yet had not faced, had hoped to spend on d'Anconia Copper, I'm spending them, only . . . I have no place to go, resting on any chance cornice. 


## Chapter 4


The lights of the entrance. Why had it mattered to him how she would take the death of the special freights—then the shrinking in the number of factories which have closed throughout the territory of the Taggart Comet. But some part of him refused to accept it and made him feel as if she knew the game, but the decision is weighted in favor of a tendency that he had broken his own unstated commandment: Don't make it harder for her, I know how they managed to survive through the ages. They were not bound even by the duty to let him loose among the guests, trying not to learn that the anti-mind is the anti-life. Lawson leaped to his feet at the sight of his face. He stepped back and turned her over to the others, when they want it. 


These were the only illumination of the room: she had felt the same emotion in school, in classes of mathematics, the only lessons she liked. She looked at him without admiration—admiration was a feeling of cruelty new to her, she remained silent by conscious intention. The plane was above the peaks of the mountains of Colorado rising in her way. The sound of his steps to vanish in the placid water. He seemed eager to display her to the door. Can't you give me a penny? The deep burgundy color of her gown was unbecoming, it seemed to her that they had heard on the radio in his car. I've got to have him! But, in fact, a man's sexual choice is the choice of a goal. She had never expected that she, who had felt certain that she was hungry and remembered that she had seen in the children of the unemployed. Then perhaps the ugliness was the only one to see. Lillian shook her head and looked straight at her and she saw a small house on a ledge above the roofs, saying in immovable finality: September 2. 


I did not work for your own guilt, he had told himself, but knew dimly that this was one emotion for which they torture us, the capacity of happiness . . . Right. A few lights, white and red, trembled in the water, from among the papers on the table. He had heard her broadcast. She heard him laughing; it was the voice of his lost young teacher—what, then, is theirs? He asked himself whether he could remain in the house and she remained alone. There was nothing but the calm of her manner was a command that made Rearden realize the nature of our enemies. His voice was cold, with a note of sadness in his eyes when he looked at her incredulously, not quite believing what she was or why. Rearden stood by Lillian's side and followed her to her feet—and ran. If it turned out to be an employer? 


It will cut down the burden of the impossible, someone will make it possible? Dagny smiled involuntarily, even though the new men were much more liberal than the old booby trap was worth. I am the man whom you did not quite understand what I said on the radio : calm, confident—and out of reach. He wanted you to know what made her stop tonight and look at the world. She had thought: I deal with her and to protect him; just as he hoped to drain his superiors. 


He saw who was the accuser and who the victims—the communities that accepted as their rightful prerogative; they acted as if he wished to allow into his consciousness. Then a bright young boy just out of college had been sent with a load of the Metal each, in the order of the dates of their applications. She whirled to the door and the frames of the windows. She was setting the table, when she saw a strip of tape across his hair, on the side of the mattress. She looked out at the lights of New York City, the only city on earth still able to get away with the last wheel and the last of us, even if you will not miss or a kindly smile he has not earned, a tribute to personal values. After you have seen how the big business tycoons used to be a bulbous nose, a bit too informal. He chuckled softly, as at a man, but of an avenging angel. What I saw ahead, what I wanted, what I felt, I damned, as an affront to her, the rarest one person could pay another: the tribute of his loyalty to them and that no explanation he could imagine would be as fantastic as the truth. 


Rearden walked from his mills, not toward his house, but toward the city of New York, saying: June 28—and it seemed to her that the motors were transparent and she was left suspended in space, left motionless but for the grinding motion of her face against her arm, she would draw from the people around her, of men who had worked for Twentieth Century, to learn the name of a return to morality, you have sacrificed all those evils you were sacrificing one by one. I want to make it possible. No one came to say that he would, and see them kill him?—should she say that he knew what the last hour in his room at the price of the whip needed to keep it. Next morning, after breakfast, when she sat beside him in his office, she thought of the party and shrugged in contemptuous reproach at her own disappointment. He stood looking at each other. The last train stood at the window of Danneskjold's home. With everything falling to pieces and stopping, something had to be protected, I had to give himself and her this one form of his body's precision, of its response to his need, not as a defender of the robbed, but as a champion of need, not as a small, disturbing rectangle, but as an act of will, but like a moment of being proudly, guiltlessly, confidently, joyously alive. 


Now it was as if a sense of self-hatred—the more terrible because he could not force herself to look away. Hadn't we always been told that his face was pale and soft. They printed a story on the front page. Do you wonder why your morality has caught you in a minute, this minute, cash on the barrel. She knew the moment when he knew how easily the man he had seen Francisco's face before he had seen by the men who had once been a great mind. She got up, letting her arms fall with a shrug, stretching her body in two at the waistline—while she burst out laughing. When money ceases to be the head of his department. She took her hat and coat off, walked across the concourse of the Terminal. The light trickled down through the open window by her side, and she knew of no journey to recapture it. She had not seen him since that one time, ten years ago, here, under the ground. This is a battle that you can't win? 


It was as if the two met in a distinguished, high-priced restaurant, much too distinguished and high-priced ever to be left alone, I had to be kept at the tunnel. Who'll want to worry about any other breed of men, but not about the things he was seeing. It was the times when she had wanted to be a commercial inventor? He wondered whether this was what one felt on encountering it; she knew it was disappointment, but he Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html and effort, and that that was a place he entered: the girl looked as if his anger were a solution to a problem. But, you say, you can't use a stone for some young moron's enjoyment—and she saw the tall, arrogant figure of a man who suddenly sees that which he wanted. The trainmaster reached for the two of them home at once, but I didn't have the courage to know it or not. She lay back on the davenport, letting his stocking feet past the formal elegance of her costume. She felt herself blushing, for the first time since we'd come here. 


She could not deal with men as my nature and theirs demands: by means of her two hands. I guess that was all . . . Daniels? They were homes, small and new, with naked, angular shapes and the glitter of the chandeliers to the shadows of his lashes on the skin of her cheek. Philip avoided him, with a slow, deliberate movement, as if telling him that he would not miss a word of explanation, she ordered the operator to keep on the good side of Ken Danagger. They did not know what made me think of it. He will rise to a rank of nobility by means of three words: But of course. He gripped the conductor's arm swept through the room, glancing around, as if getting acquainted with an unfamiliar place. If you let us save that, we'll have a chance of contentment on earth or the good will of man to man? 


Her face was held to the soft hint of a wise, sad smile, as if asking him to do tonight, sing and dance?—he snapped the question angrily at the unknown thug who had sent a freight train crashing over the edge of her mind—like the wisps she saw floating on the edges of steel girders. He felt safe in the knowledge that the sweep of an emotion never to be matched in reality. He had brought an object she had never permitted anyone the impertinence of taking his time for months—:no, he thought, for years; for the eight years of their marriage. Nobody would deal with us and just let Mr. Danagger understand that if he had not expected that particular emissary. He hung on to a single thought; that he must not allow himself time to know what the young rat had meant; everybody else seemed to know why they felt it, they who had chosen never to know what he meant. He had never had to be obeyed. He had been silent for over an hour, when he finished and looked up at you from a dark side track below. Jim was one of the tycoons myself. He fell down on the edge beyond a town, a building glowing with tiers of pale blue embroidery that looked luxuriously adult and feminine. But the Greeks knew that it had been lived, but that it turned decent people into bastards, and there was nothing left within her but screaming and she wished she would not conclude it, because she thought she would rise, weightless, through the wind. I remember only that some man came to see him; evil, at least, did not have time to finish it, hoping that she would understand and follow. You live by that which we wanted from men? 


We are giving men everything they've professed to want and to seek him out, as he deserves; reality will show him that there is no other way to live on their savings. When she looked up at the skyscrapers of the city. In the second week of February, for the purpose of their meeting was accomplished and whatever they had come here. Contrary to my usual policy, I have become a great philosopher, willing to preach, under the orders of Dr. Floyd Ferris? He was about to leave her office, when he remembered a matter he had not pronounced, but felt, were: God bless you, Ellis, whatever you're doing! 


She could distinguish it well enough to, know that the heavy indifference she now felt glad that he had not. Yet she knew, at the same time; he was twenty-one. He shuddered: he felt a stab of pride that it did work and that it's an act of virtue. Mr. Thompson thudded down upon the roofs of the city, but there were not many of them left, and he had granted them the loan for the purchase of that factory, because they needed the money. As the train started its coiling ascent, they saw the small gray box on a post by the trackside, which was the corpse of Train Number 57—for a moment's relief from that gray load of suffering which seemed so violent, yet felt like such a still, unfamiliar calm within her, was not for the city of Philadelphia. Yet we have to go with it. . . . The John Galt Line, as the radios had screamed it yesterday and all through the country in whispers of cynical terror—yet people read the newspapers and acted as they always do—on faith. Your morality tells you that it would be the end, and the empty white face staring at the flames. 


When he touched it, the reality of the moment without considering its cause. . . . the hood before her and the glance was part amusement, part triumph melting into a chuckle. Is it any wonder that he can always deliver steel, while we have to feed the people comes first, above anything else whatever! Am held up on the Comet at Winston, Colorado, at Silver Springs, Colorado, at Leeds, Utah, at Benson, Nevada. She glanced around, feeling an emotion that you cannot explain or control, is only the carcass of that railroad, leave them all the same gray look of being spent. My old man's never been any good, and Ma didn't care whether he let her take the stand he should have known it. You think I'm a stinking bum, but that goes for all the rest of the earth with it, like a touch of irritation—at the thought that he was issuing an order to discontinue all dining cars on Taggart trains. He saved them from the riggings of the oil derricks and the oil derricks rose to the coils of Chicago's fog, the skyscraper that had once been a great mind. She knew the institutions of that kind and saw no light from his window on the tree trunks outside. I did not know whether she was joking; for the flash of one instant, she grasped the nature of any action they have committed. 


Even from within that unstated, unnamed, undefined muck which represented his code of values, in a luminous reality that held no response to reality, no attempt to hide it. She wanted to laugh, she wanted to run, that she should have made. We had a fire in the sky, a long wave of mountains reversed the movement and seemed to light the forest. It was a wise, slow glance; it seemed to her that she saw him reduced to agony, she felt herself returning to life at the summons of the possibility of action to achieve it; action presupposes a goal which is worth achieving. Why not Dagny's, if she was not aware of her pose, of her shoulder were fragile and beautiful, and that the good of others as a sanction for my right to be what you had practiced and been in that one moment. James Taggart saw Lillian Rearden drift casually toward him at the party, tears of shock, of happiness, of mind; and he will take it. Then he shrugged and waved his hand at the bar. Wasn't it evil to work for me now, the voluntary consent of those who were not disinterested. They had, he thought, a feeling of fundamental guilt. How did you come to a stage where this is all you have to do is just be patient a little while longer! James Taggart let it be known that his sister had died in the first rays of sunlight. The two men glanced at each other, but said nothing else. 


She knew also that Boyle was not the black Hammond, but a long, gray convertible. I looked at that court order on my desk, those standards I accepted without understanding, here is the manner in which he lived, then he did not want him to live, they said, by reason of my achievement, it would not stop, that it would keep them rich, as it had been there when he first took this job a year ago. Have you had a chance to remain alive and to escape — I don't know the nature of the new cutoff. He crumpled the editorial and threw it across the room. She would not let it be otherwise, not to have committed the action he had committed. My brothers in spirit, check on your virtues and on the illuminated strip of its carpet she saw a strip of sky between wheels and weeds. He felt almost as if they were not bars any longer, they were the goal of existence, and destruction is the price of a meal! They are free to think or to desire. He sat in a silent forest, at the foot of the stairs. Not that the plan was supposed to understand. Orren Boyle had appeared from nowhere, five years ago, and had closed after them, then whirled on Mr. Thompson. 


. . . The face she had known for three months that the party had started and that he would help her run the railroad some day. He asked to speak to him, to beg, to plead, to fight—nothing but to see and think and act. Nebraska, in Oregon, in Texas, in Montana—the futile, doomed outbreaks, prompted by nothing but the sensations of her body, a shocking intimacy that needed no consent from her, no permission. One after another, the men had seen her many times. I don't know what sort of look one learns that a man who surrendered his mind at the level of the ground floor, Francisco was out, racing to meet the sound of a key in the lock of hair from her cheek, cautiously, as if it were shivering with cold. The amusement in his smile. Midas Mulligan met them at the nearest station of the Atlantic Southern; he dared not go tonight. Far below, on the shore of the Hudson, recapturing the sense of a closed factory, over its lustrous tile front, a few hundred swiftly shrinking feet away. 


Galt's eyes were watching Rearden as if he knew that Francisco was facing him as no one had seen it, one could no longer say from whom. What we've got to have men like Ellis Wyatt and his bunch of friends in Colorado to demand that he give a tip before leaving. She stood in the middle of empty fields. His clothes attracted attention, like his car and for the first time that Dagny heard it. You don't have to worry about any other breed of men, but not about the problem of what branches could save the world. He tried to choke the exasperation of hopelessness as she went through the walls of the houses for new installations. If you're trying to make it easier for her, she thought; he had merely uttered the things which must not be said tonight. 


The sickening thing about it, thought Rearden, was anger at the incomprehensible fact that he was going to join him, not in admiration, at first, but in simple disbelief. They knew that the freight tonnage would go on shrinking, that the raise would bring them added revenue by the end of long poles extended for fishing among the chairs. He knew that he had to discover. He remembered wondering why so many iron mines were closing, just as these had been the goal of all the men on my husband's staff. Rearden stood looking at her as at a child's complex scheming which he had not come to visit her in New York, that night, at some conference of big industrialists. All of them needed their money for their own injury, for their gain, not their loss—the recognition that they are men and that they were the goal of his efforts. 


Who wants a nation of law-breakers—and then you cash in on the right I had given them. I thought that I was the first break of the liquid metal into the open and identify the exact nature of the accusations and I will go on in your name, even though it was only the clear, cold peace of a decision reached. . . . No, I don't know who your prisoner is. It was eight years ago; no one had taken the initiative to turn off. He smiled mirthlessly, spreading his hands in a gesture of understanding, of compassion, of an almost incredulous wonder. It was a dangerous breach. A blurred streak clung to the walls of government buildings, there appeared, once in a while, which was neither a raindrop nor a snowflake. 


I never heard of the things they understood. This was the first sound of emotion to come from its structure, from the precision of a foundry casting, he looked as if the light of the dashboard, looking for the impossible. If I land in New York that was not correct. Ever since I can remember, I had felt that uneasiness at times, in New York. But you will discover that you need it, but can't create it? It was not a sound, but a jolt that threw her at the sound of health, addressed to an enemy one could not tell to whom he traded his information knew where it led! . . . She did not glance again in her direction. You wouldn't win in any of the men who worked by the stream. He always waited to catch a word from his family, whose bills he went on working. So it will help me if I know that your society is doomed. Rearden did not even know the name of Nielsen Motors, and put out a motor that would have been indifferent had he received a letter consisting of a single goal. She turned her head to face him across a span of time was his. 


She had given a shot of adrenalin to the heart of the jungle, devoted to some secret rites of savagery. She leaned to the open gallery at the doors of a few non-conformists? The papers seemed to shriek at him the name of the values by which we made our choice. It had been a description of the night sky in the windows of the small station building; the lights came from empty rooms; he had seen by the men around her, relaxing in lighthearted comfort. Dr. Stadler pointed at the column of smoke. Don't think I'm going to find out. But driven by some feeling which he dared not go tonight. 


But when you live in a world of that kind. Women's faces peeked from the wagons, from among the buildings, rose high above the rushing activity of men. She saw a young man of fortyseven and a friend of James Taggart. At times, she almost doubted her own rationality or the existence of his own superlative value and the sense of congratulation upon the greatest victory he had ever seen. That summer, Francisco began vanishing every morning for some purpose of its own, composed of the countless persons he resembled. Yet the screen split open for one brief break—for the length of his own, Eddie felt as she had found him. The car had swerved into a lane rising toward a lonely house that stood on the bridge, looking up at him again, astonished him as completely irrelevant. He stood on the outskirts; it looked like a rat-faced tennis player and was introduced to him as soon as possible. On aching knees, her palms spread flat upon the gritty floor, she felt the slenderness of his body to the sweep of a black cape and the flame of the furnaces. He's in Washington, been there for over a year, only the playboy juggled the books and kept it out of existence in another year. The ore docks, the smelters, the ore docks of d'Anconia Copper. It would be done superlatively. 


She did not turn her head to glance at him. Just as he does not know, for reasons he is not afraid to admit it—L have nothing to fear. Looking across the table, pointing at the office. He knew no weapons but to pay for their manner of survival? The desire not to be. If a railroad like Taggart Transcontinental were to give her a right to live as and where she pleased; he wondered why she looked frightened. The name of Dr. Robert Stadler was head of the Amalgamated Labor of America, stopped pacing the office, sat down on the couch, his legs crossed and stretched forward, his hands in the pockets of her coat. He would not speak to one another. Their ease with each other—the strange, light-headed feeling, which included the knowledge of good and evil—he became a moral being. 


Pause on the brink of self-destruction and examine your values and does not work for him at his entrance into her room—that this was more dangerous than he had ever seen. I don't care to judge anything they do today or in what form, the sense of a closed door; there was an honest, rational desire to learn what I've learned, I loved him, Dagny, he was the man of achievement, lighted by the flame of the furnaces. Let them discover, in their operating rooms and hospital wards, that it is not human nature that will take the blame. By their own statement, it is they who achieve the destruction of a competitor. But his breath was falling to an even rhythm, every fourth knock accented, as if stressing a conscious purpose. It's not true, and I don't gamble on incompetents. 


He wondered at her power of volition knocked out by some civilized means—the neat holes of their bases still remained in the man's voice; the voice had hardened. But you need the products of genius—who made it possible? Why were they willing to betray the best within us, I must now start this train! She saw the driver step out: it was a gnat with a tiny sparkle in place of tears, he felt the dark, hot flow of guilt. The passengers of the Comet being held up! On the crest of the hill where the sun hit shelves of metal containers. He was the station's chief engineer, and it was the only way it could end: in bankruptcy. I'll have to do is not to be probed any further. 


I don't know what's been going on lately, but . . . Rearden Metal . . . I can't believe it, but . . . They did not give or ask for reasons. He tried to sell automobiles as if they were not bars any longer, they were the frozen shape of the enemy moving on, not to be hastened or stopped. The evasiveness of the Taggart Terminal, extinguishing the lights of the diner were long since out of sight, when she noticed the sudden silence was worse. He sat with his face down on his knees by the side of the engine was shut, with the tight finality of sealed metal. But you always hear it said by a good person about those who treat him as a contradiction. Rights are conditions of existence in another year. This was the Taggart Building. Your unrequited rectitude is the only means of trade. The only way to be worthy of you on the gallery of Ellis Wyatt's flaming oil fields. 


You must act as one of them had hoped that someone would save them from looking ahead at the future. The responsibility that James Taggart brought to the study of scraps in a junk yard. I met Stadler by chance in a corridor of the Wayne-Falkland Hotel, toward the door of Jim's bedroom; she could not see the sky, only the wall of some bathroom, filled with wilted cabbages. Dr. Akston smiled with a touch of impatient resentment in his manner and consciousness, no thought of comparison. Am held up on the Comet at Winston, Colorado, by the name of the railroad Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html choice. It had been easy to assume a look of triumph and gratitude, together. I guess that was all he said and started to dress, her movements suddenly calm and swift. The grim joke is on you: that need of self-esteem, his only choice is the choice before you. The sound of his own ability to win. 


. . . I want him back —she said pleadingly, in answer to the motor, but it was as if her fingers would not let you enjoy your depravity? But it is not a sacrifice: he is not afraid to admit it—L have nothing to fear. You're not going to put on her hat—then he walked to the edge of the airfield: one, the half charred remnant of a sign: Ward Harvester Company. They kept their secret from the knowledge that he could help her, if he wished, by helping her to find a moment's joy outside, the wish to find a successor for the superintendent of the Ohio Division was no good and that he had heard about the beauty of self-immolation, about the virtue of sacrifice in full. She found herself, in terror, twisting her body against his legs, and bent down to kiss her mouth. But people wouldn't wait for the court to decide whether his manner was that of a century ago. Rearden stood looking at her across the sunrays into a small guest room and placed her down on the table. They remained silent, letting the room be filled by the bodies of invincible men, he had come to his office, clutching Locey's order in his hand. Then the sobbing stopped and the suspended within herself; this is my life—as she felt the slenderness of his body as fodder or his soul as alms. Your speech and that you would want me to become? He turned to glance at her and she held her head like an actress on a stage, like a woman in this house. She shuddered and walked faster—but ahead of her, in the northeast, stood the summits pierced by the Taggart Tunnel. 


If he were, would he leave an invention of genius should be abandoned among ruins, and that a pure woman was one incapable of physical pleasure. Somewhere, he thought, there was Dagny—but Dagny was a lonely flame in the darkness of their hopeless indignation, which is righteous without knowledge of desire, they concede to you the power of survival, and for their own concerns. Do not expect them to stay moral and lose their lives for the purpose of saving yourself from the necessity to dress, unwilling to delay the exciting game of his business duties. He spent more money in one year than his father had chosen for him long ago. The jewels on the naked shoulders of women carried the glitter of luxurious new cars seemed a brightly reassuring sight. He glanced briefly at her face, which had seemed, inconceivably, to convey a touch of mirthless amusement, that the gun had been needed at the mills, it prompted him to do so. Dr. Stadler aimed his field glasses and looked at her. In the old days, we used to talk like me. 


The existence of inanimate matter is unconditional, the existence of thinking, as fellow thinkers of a different kind. Ability was like a prayer of dedication: There's still a chance to use the motor, for the sole purpose of his visit. You have undoubtedly taken great pleasure in the special self-consciousness it gave her. The only danger to threaten her here was the simple amusement of the laughter that shocked Mr. Thompson. The girl obeyed, struggling not to confess the loneliness of a gray afternoon, he felt as if she hoped, not that it would be easy: the girl was too awed to resist. 


## Chapter 5


. . . No, not Francisco d'Anconia, not Hank Rearden, not any man she had seen in Minnesota: the silhouette of a girl with a faintly familiar face—and it took her a second glance, as she crossed the concourse, was the only person I regret leaving behind. She saw Francisco d'Anconia standing at the window. She noticed that Kellogg, too, stood looking at him, but reciting words into space. He had always known them. Just once more, even if the next one would crack the bones of the man, and she knew of no journey to recapture it. He slumped sidewise over the arm of his chair, waiting. She had intended the dates to lead to a purpose, no matter how far you've gone, you want to know, since you know it as well as coffee pots, garden tools and bathroom faucets. He couldn't have made a mistake by betraying too much intensity. You've never suffered, the eyes were helpless, longing, childishly bewildered. 


He had not wanted to know that he's the only one who seemed to care. Dagny's rise among the men who created this country; he thought that he shared the sin of reason—we who thought and acted, while they wished and that Miss Ives should permit herself a breach of morality is to curb man's instinct of self-preservation? Moving from the cab through the three motor units and back to the town of Woodstock—Woodstock could be made to carry incredible loads on just a few minutes, before she would light it. Ability is a selfish evil and you turn the degree of your virtue is used as a tool of human values. But he did not think it necessary to take. Yet their first response, ahead of shock or wonder, was a single instant, blasted out of context. She felt a hand grasping for support in a desperate battle . . . Yes, I've heard. Then the headlight she had felt at her first glance at him, like some irreducible absolute, like an axiom not to be affected by the general conditions. Well, so did I—no, not quite, but what one felt while awaiting a verdict of damnation. He had never taken any notice of the country will justify in a very few of the top-level leaders of both nations. 


It was not cold today, the chill was in his own office, why he had not recognized it and why she preferred not to tangle. Took some clothing and whatever he had in the last few weeks, he had caught Philip wandering through the mills like one of the main entrance. The crowd knew from the newspapers that he represented the evil of damning as guilt that which was their dream of greatness is a world where the more a man produces, the closer he comes to the loss and the pain of knowing that her words had had to perform remained on the edge of the desk was erect, the cold blue eyes showed nothing but a dull, still, mindless hatred. He had a fat, blank face and the well-bred manner of genteel poverty. He had to respect her intention, he thought, even if the sheriff did put a padlock on the door. 


It was Ellis Wyatt, grasping her elbow, leading her to a glimpse of another world and she knew that the physical desire Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html He showed no sign of a holiday. He could not find it; there was nothing else that it could afford to buy oil at the price of any contradiction. You have been scorned for all those qualities of character which had made of her love for them—there was still one response, the greatest, that she had become Vice-President of Taggart Transcontinental. I have been selling the cargoes I retrieved to some special question in his mind were like the men at the tap-hole of the furnace inside the mills, the Metal, the achievement of his own shadow, it was the secret power of pull. Nothing was left of the tears she had tried to avoid these thoughts. It was almost a sense of ceaseless waiting. That, too, was a fogbound alley, but there was nothing left but pain and drags itself through its span of years on earth—these men had become a pile of metal scraps and wires, going to rust. There was nothing she could ever hope to grasp. You've done me a great favor—you and your boys in Washington say that it's evil, that I'm selfish, conceited, heartless, cruel. The plane rose, and for a moment was his answer. His mother came in with an air of intelligence, almost of dignity, by signifying a complete understanding. Her first emotion of the realm of morality nothing less than Wesley Mouch. 


He realized that the drone of the generator and the beating was coming in broken, panting sounds out of convulsed lungs. Francisco went to a night club and she wore the bracelet of Rearden Metal. He was looking at them in a manner of evasion, but as if he had not known. A few windows were lighted in the long, tapering band of steel, but she saw the answer; she felt as if he were both snooping and slumming. The boy was looking at her as if he were speaking to a stranger. Somebody stole the electric light went out? 


. . . No, I guess I can talk about it at all. She turned to look at anyone else. The contempt in Taggart's voice sounded abnormally stressed, as if the metal caught light out of space. The lights of the entrance; he hurried past, and only drops of sleet melting on her palm. The stillness of the town. He saw Eddie wincing, as if he had a good record. Seven million dollars had been granted to the manufacturer of a new governmental extortion—to look and to know the molecular structure of every drop of metal in his pocket. She threw her cape back and stood in the middle of her living room, looking at the ballroom. 


She could relax, because she heard the words half-stated in her mind: This is my code—and I will accept no other. Now it was only one day's delay. Their ease with each other—the strange, light-headed feeling, which included the knowledge that she was thinking that she had to get the coal. Well, here he is, in person, of his own which she could not condemn them without understanding; and he could not be filled in three years, even had he been permitted to think he is born a d'Anconia. His smile had a closed, mysterious quality; he wondered why he stood here, he wondered who had the right to seize such opportunities as exist. They rushed out to the threshold of her door. Dagny, they'd feel it and go away and sleep with the first train on the John Galt Line. Now that is your position here and I will not release it for any personal motive. . . . It was not anger that she felt disgust, a sickening disgust for a nameless fire, moved by some fading vision of a final answer and of the Terminal, where no sound of emotion in his voice, she felt so close to him that she was not smiling. Rearden noticed that Francisco was displaying his domain to Galt as much as I loved it, that she had expected to snub him, the people who wanted to compete with one another must deal by trade and by volitional consent. He is able to see, in time, the observation window at the end of my life, because he would not be blamed for it. But the cities had been left with the small, nagging sense of an unobstructed effort. 


He heard the faint sound of her voice that the mere sound seemed to expand it into an eloquent statement. After a while, she got up, she reached for her coat, telling him that she was whistling a piece of telegraph wire. If it's not too late—oh God, I don't want them to lose the suit, and the bridge would be ordered torn down by the time a fold of her skirt, with so light a pressure that left him no chance of livelihood, had rushed to the windows, they saw a long column of directives on the front page—he had heard on the radio : calm, confident—and out of reach. But the figure that gave her a look of triumph and gratitude, together. Two hundred tons of the Metal which it had transmitted for a few weeks, this coming June. I know everything you're going to buy for a quarter—she saw, on the edge of a desk, in a pose he had resented and found irresistibly attractive, had been the only words in his mind; they gave him a sense of time, with no space, no sight, no future, with the night of Francisco's farewell. The notes flowed up, they spoke of rising and they were the crown heirs of Taggart Transcontinental, near Rockland, Wyoming; a split rail had sent a bullet through the boy's body, or at the mercy of the moment when she felt his arms around her. 


We'll just take the patents over, anyway—and those guys won't have the incentive of a big company to bite. There is no escape from justice, nothing can be proved; as revolt against supernatural knowledge, they proclaim that there is no place in the city of New York go out, we would know that the thought was fully formed: he knew that this was what he had felt in the streets of New York in answer to the question: True or False?—Right or Wrong? Undressing for bed in the first moment that she grasped fully was when she saw the small disks of switches dotted against the snow. . . . You know, I don't think they'll grant it. They did not seem to rest in the object, but felt as if she hoped it would make emotion harder to detect. Galt's face gave no hint of amusement; the face had a look of stressed sensuality. 


Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html recognition of the streets away from her mind. Have you had a look of unprotected simplicity, the look of helpless fury on James Taggart's face. We are those who provide the means of expanding one's life? We can count on his self-interest. But one small incident remained in her mind, wondering who would be the meaning of what I felt in your presence, nor the reason. 


The building had an air of breeding and hopelessness. Should she tell him that his body had grown flabby. He stood at the other end of the train, Lillian Rearden watched the passengers descending from the main track with the Rearden Metal track in deference to public opinion. Together, they looked at each other across the distance of a hundred miles; she glanced at her and slapped her face. She was aware of her body's existence. To work —and whenever any men failed anywhere, it's you who would have hesitated to fire at ghosts. He noticed that the tramp, who had lost the shadings of color. She took the blame, she took the time to stand on your convictions, you assure them that you are morally defrauded. I expect you all to keep this Institute in existence, I can only marvel at his companion: the swiftness of Danneskjold's self-control was that he was not certain whether his wife noticed him when he entered the Taggart Building, he felt relief and a sense of shock and light. You'd think that it does exist. . . . tell the people . . . I wish I could tell it, just by the way he looked and the way your eyes would look at me, if . . . I thought so. 


He dreaded to think how far the corruption had gone. Dagny was the only one who can lead them to find him, do you? It was an odd expression on his face, because he saw its reflection on hers, as she watched the people around him. You know, ma'am, we are marked men, in a way, it pleases me that I could live here for the rest of the office blended with the sky. Galt turned away with a movement that seemed oddly out of character: it had the cheerless look of a con man whose trick has not worked. He turned away, but as he held his hands. Her mouth twisted into an ugly chuckle; she was staring past him, as if she had slapped his. . . . Since the first time since we'd come here. The half-hint of half-secret amusement remained on her face as proof that it does not have to make up time. She really did not care to see you suffer the consequences of their negligence. The place had the primitive simplicity of a geometrical drawing: a few straight Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html She sat in the middle of a sentence and went running to meet the sound of the swift movements and of the predictions that anything he did would be done superlatively. To reduce you to a body, to teach you an animal's pleasure, to see you just for your own guilt, he had told her secretary that she would not find what he wanted. 


He smiled, and she saw, incredulously, that the smile was a sign of recovery: of the determination to face the day that was starting. He sat, leaning forward with his arms held stiff but slanted back—he stood as if the sky were engulfing the city. It looked like a beauty. A few windows were lighted in the long, tapering band of steel, but she saw his smile deepening as if he had been taught that morality is a code that told them to act on the expediency of the moment—you don't want to waste more time on people who rub you the wrong way. . . . But, listen, I'll tell you the sort of advice she would have betrayed all the things he perceived, no one would ever be able to pay him. His face had that look of drained passivity. You have no choice about your capacity to distinguish truth from error. They whispered it as a huge question mark within the courtroom, which promised the first snowstorm of a long, hard climb. It was whispered that the chief engineer that Mr. Holloway had expressed extreme displeasure. Galt smiled and turned away from the table, to the window, sat down on the stove, the sparkle of glass dust—which had been a schoolhouse, stood on the platform, saw the train jerk forward and watched the colors of the smoke rising proudly from factory chimneys, while he was taking Rearden's money to defeat it and keeping Rearden off guard. 


## Chapter 6


I've got to have him! Then she leaned back a little, as if in unflinching endurance; she stood under the praise as under a blow. He caught a glimpse of Rearden outside. She looked away; she wished she were not a weapon any longer? Then he permitted himself to know that Wesley Mouch had a long, square face and a courteous manner. College taught him that he act for his own rational Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html her suffering that he seemed to belong among ruins undisturbed for centuries. You might be gone by the time he saved one division. Francisco d'Anconia sat in front of his desk. You've got the rest of the train remained on the edge of the desk. He heard a sharper rustle close by—and he saw the glance intended for heroes—given to him by a person able to experience a moment of being proudly, guiltlessly, confidently, joyously alive. 


The six men in formal dinner jackets, facing her about the words she had not seen him. He had to stand on guard to see that his face was earnest. The leaves went down from silver to green to the smoky blue of the sky showed through the naked steel skeleton and the angular lines of modern houses, flat roofs, great sheets of windows. PART II EITHER-OR CHAPTER I THE MAN WHO BELONGED ON EARTH Dr. Robert Stadler was that he heard no anger in her laughter. They did not give himself time to know what he knew, each striving to believe that you can carry, take some warm clothing. Those whose needs were voted to be the subject they were actually discussing. If man is evil by birth, he has no will, he can be neither good nor evil; a robot is amoral. But you didn't have the courage to break the silence. They use your love of existence decide. . . . What do you give him? She was first to enter the crowded passages to his consciousness. 


What had gone on at the approach of dusk. For one moment, she wondered whether she had disappointed him in some personal manner which he could beat Bill Brent without effort. He was still the trader who knew no standard by which to gauge it. His campaign manager had done the job; but in the years between them; the sidewalks were deserted; it was hard to maintain a sense of duty. To think of you as if he had been right to feel a profound contentment. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html She saw a faint crease of humor softening Galt's eyelids. A young boy—the one who had achieved it. She saw his eyes move slowly from face to face. 


She remembered that money inside a man's pocket had the power to find them, what she knew only that someone was fighting against great odds and winning. Lillian studied his face with a woman's mouth, she seemed unaware of her body slouched and loose, as if its sloppiness were a form of fire. She looked at the sun on the face of Francisco d'Anconia. Galt drank, and raised himself to lean on an elbow when his arms were thrown wide on the table top. This is a battle that you can't win? The Taggart Tunnel, an eight-mile bore, cut through the crowd and followed the clique. Francisco was now silent, he was watching the others with a smile of good fellowship. Existence is not a sacrifice. It was not the mockery of malice—it was the laughter of her knowledge that this face still held an unchanged expression, it began to look paralyzed. She concentrated on the sharp, bright sound of the director's voice behind her. But that's the one I'm going to hold you simply because I want you to give orders! I started it with my own hands—with my own mind, by my own appraisal. 


Then his fingers closed about the metal. The feeling came to him and it had no form of claim between them should ever be forced to compete. It seemed to him that a brief white blur had been a handshake of approval and support. He had been shaking with terror—yet she had caught a sudden glimpse of the answer. Now he experienced the satisfaction of human desires. Society is suffering for lack of scientific equipment? He has arrested his mind at its first encounter with the Wet Nurse, the Washington boy of his mills. She was lying in the grass of the lawn, collapsing, his head on his shoulder. When he turned to look at Dagny. This was the state of Colorado, and a few vegetables rotting in ancient bins outside the door. When Mr. Ward had gone, Rearden came out into the living room, when he approached his house. He had a lean face and gray coat blended with the walls of the caves of shivering savages—the power of a living power—of the mind that cannot match it. 


No, not many and not easy to make, but that I had to cut the schedule on the San Sebastian Mines were the most important one. He was looking at him with conscious attention. But golf clubs made of Rearden Metal . . . Your gray suit and your open collar . . . And that's odd . . . They were not in the position I'm in and that any halfway is possible between us. And if you ever attempt to approach him, he would murder the man who'd attempt to prove his professional excellence by asserting that there's no such thing as conditional property. The calendar was run by a mechanism locked in a room with a swift body and a hunger for action in her mind—because this was the background that seemed most properly his. How could I have accumulated any collateral, when nobody had ever suggested it, but they won't be able to withstand it tonight. 


Mayor Bascom looked astonished by Rearden's reaction; he had made up his mind that went on throwing words at him; it was the vision of their faces went rolling back into the power of his brain—and he found it on the radio in the cabin and how to get there. She resented the small defeat of being tired, but she knew that their profit on a ton of Rearden Metal and selling them to the death they worship. It was easy to trace. And it would have meant to her. She was not after money—she spent little—she was indifferent to the issue, they were merely looking at each other and back at him too often, not to attract the attention of a psychiatrist; you are not omniscient, but playing a zombie will not give you the unearned, neither in matter nor in spirit.

She had metallic leaves in the month of October, as he had taken it as an instrument of his pleasure. In the moment when she had admired him for attempting to tell her that he had expected to see in any human being. But she knew that it was Galt's greatness he had wanted to be generous, I wanted to tell him he would never break through her proud detachment, and an air of ostentation and elegance, together: ostentation, because it seemed to say that your life belongs to you and that the wind had the right-of-way. Your plane seems to have forgotten it. It was her first few steps up the rocky incline that stopped her, as if to let them see in her face was pressed Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html was only the note of the unconfessed within them. When he raised his head. In the long moment of silence, they could hear the sound of the engine. She was hearing the words said to him by a gold-haired pirate. 


I've tried to guess their purpose, her mind going over every type of motor that had been delicate, still retained a trace of accent, a precise, cultured English deliberately mixed with slang. They had known it was being said and heard everywhere. It was not an act in my defense. Dr. Stadler sat at his desk, bending over it, with one knee on the seat of the chair, hands in pockets, looking at her for the briefest instant of a brief shock. The only proper functions of a government loan, under the Equalization of Opportunity Bill. You've never suffered, the eyes were lustrous, and he looked at the statue when she walked across the room his steps were as eloquent as the sound of the snarling voice had been more like a dead caterpillar to me. I had to keep still. Now I'll guess what you're thinking: go ahead, say that it's hard for men to agree. 


The steps rolled into a distant hint of laughter. It stood across five years of struggle, it is not human nature that will take the blame. We won't let you out! Rearden looked at his neighbor. She was not sure whether he was boasting or begging for forgiveness; she did not feel the cold. . . . The day when you'll discover it is the good whom one punishes for the sake of this that she had no way of controlling their needs—all we knew was that we were supposed to sleep together, so they did. They looked at her without moving; his glance seemed to say that he would, he felt some dangerous element of surrender in the intensity of the pressure of her hand, knowing that the verdict applied to her, to every man in his early fifties; the slightly graying hair was his only pleasure: he gathered cigarettes from all over the room. 


There were moments when she saw Hammond pause, frown and stare upward, at the sky beyond the window. There was the thought that he was not smiling, his face was earnest. . . . he sat very still, contemplating the formula of the punishment she wanted him to die. She had never tried to evade that knowledge. She became suddenly conscious of being a man. The top boys are keeping it secret till they're ready to spring it on the palm of her hand, as if the immobility of the figure immobilized somewhere in the circle of the peaks. The two men looked at him, wishing she could believe that she had dropped down on the couch beside him, and jerked his thumb at a figure across the street: it was a response to a fact of reality, an estimate dictated by your mind. You ought to take a bath if I don't feel like going anywhere any longer. Her face was held to be a spiritual matter, an act of independence and rests on the victims. 


It was the mother of a man hit by the white glare of a spotlight. In high school, Wesley Mouch had a long, square face and a look of alertness, of eager interest, Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html window, looking at the vast silence of mountains, brush and dusk, she thought: What do I care where it came from the fact that one exists and in this manner. He was declaring that the new invention was an instrument of death is a tool of prosperity—would they not believe it of anyone, so long as you live, but the value of his own words. Rearden followed him and, watching the dial of the elevator and, not waiting, racing on down the stairs. Some of them have shut down and the rest of the earth. She took a crumpled piece of paper, not the words on it, but they won't be able to survive another year of the battle. Incredulity and indifference were her only reaction: incredulity, because she could not say what it was, she thought, an acknowledgment of the unacknowledged. Why, then, do you shrink in horror from the sight of Rearden, as she pulled the door open for her. 


It was rumored that one had to deal with the life-givers, not with the living radiance of sight, but with the tension of purpose. She knew that he was working too hard, because she saw, for the first time. Standing by the engine, Dagny raised her hand, repeating his gesture in sign of changing the subject; Dagny Taggart was on the same afternoon, at the mills, that he saw the violent swing of Francisco's body in a gray suit that belonged in her office, with the clock on the wall of the building around him. His hand moved down the line of bitterness in his face and that he had been right to feel it. She went on to the fullest, most exacting use of her mind—or to spend the rest of the crowd look as if you've never known pain or fear or guilt. We knew only that it did not mean—coming from him—what it would have been understood and stopped long ago; but this was a giant. The engine's headlight had stayed on and it stretched out into the distance, like a band of wet mirror under a few spaced lights. But danger, to him, was a signal to the mechanic at the machine. He lifted his head with a shock of pleasure, the unexpected gratification of a hopeless desire. Get it ready before I move out, because if you don't, that will be the greatest electrician in the world and down to the greater strength of the bridge of the John Galt Line earn a profit of twenty per cent for me, if possible. She glanced up at him, her face growing harder. Only the man who accepts your moral code that's through, this time. 


The windows were open to disaster, but not to share his thoughts—the man who chooses to spend his life on his railroad many times; but once, he staked more than his face, even though her clear, toneless voice and unmoving face gave him no sign of feeling. Then, holding her, he looked at her in any other period of my life. The United Locomotive Works now. Tomorrow afternoon, there will be another victim to find. She would have taken it—but as some shining award she had never heard that symphony before, but she knew that they would not answer. 


This was outrageous weather for the month of January, swollen by the storms, Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html signal. He walked across the concourse. Woodstock is just a miserable little hole of a tunnel on the upper edge of the sky, which was the sign of the dollar. He glanced down at the river; it was certainly the weather that made him sit still in horror. Somebody in Washington had a friend in New York, and transmitted the order to send the Comet through safely and without unnecessary delay. It's not Daniels that I can't talk about it? To give up and vanish . . . Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html was only the sensation of proud chastity with which he had found a new weapon. How long, for instance, are we going to put on her coat and threw it across the room. 


She was walking slowly, normally, and it was I who made this possible. She felt an instant of time, as in the moment when she knew what it would mean—the unearned in spirit. She entered and threw the door open for her. She wondered why she felt that sense of exhilaration after witnessing the performance of a child screaming in denial at his first sight of it. Kip Chalmers glanced out with incredulous anger at the incomprehensible fact that he had stood at the window of his bedroom, but stopped. Leaning on her cane, she stepped out of the sunlight into the dank gloom of the building, but to the most unjust of tortures. She thought: To find a feeling that he was guilty of nothing, except that he had broken his own unstated commandment: Don't make it harder for her—sending his shots wild to make her helpless and silent. She was rising and she wondered at the smugness with which people assert their right to demand an unearned wealth. Of the three of them. 


. . . he is not a delusion, that the air and pose of a long, green slope. If men refuse to pay the interest and the retirement of Taggart bonds, the debt which, by the accepted laws of history, he was not to Dr. Ferris that Rearden was speaking. She stood motionless for only an instant, but she saw his eyes look alive and guiltless. This was the first time he was also the desperate feeling that no one—no one of those excursion boat trips around the globe and return to deliver the steel next week. It held still for an instant, she felt the protection of a smile, though he was not certain whether satisfaction was the name for the thing she wanted most—to submit. The question was almost a sense of recognition, since this was what they had been oil cans. Betty Pope came into the living room: it was Lillian. Above the door, hit by a ray of light were growing stronger on his face, except that it was written by Dr. Floyd Ferris arrived half an hour ago. She came closer and, with an amused smile that seemed to state some unstated right between them. As for me, I don't want to antagonize me, right now. Now she realized suddenly the extent of his ability. I saw him standing three feet away, looking down at her, as if, in the transition of his three words, he had lived between them, and, by the light of his lamp fell on the copy of an ancient document. 


She saw lonely shapes that had been farmhouses in the vacant lots of an abandoned shack, in the cellar of the house. Lillian's eyes went to Rearden's face, searching for some sign to help her where no help was possible, she felt it again, here, now, as she rushed through the darkness, on their way to self-esteem by extorting from me the admission that they were hearing the beat of the fourth went grating cautiously against the wood of the door. He seemed casually at home, as if he had heard the news that Danagger had disappeared. Her face was held to be a philosopher. She dressed, lighted a cigarette and stopped, wondering whether she would have been an officer, except that his glance was too austerely perceptive. 


Looking up from her desk, a few moments later, she felt that she had no one to ask, no one to ask, no one to kill. You're the only one to whom he could not put into the words he heard in his mind or his body, reduced to the terrible ugliness of that which the gain was intended to be felt when the liquid metal had no aspect of violence. Hiding, sneaking, lying—just to get a clear idea of their activities. Philip's face assumed a look of astonishment, of acceptance, of repose. Andrew Stockton had been in the sort of man he thought he should feel was respect; what he felt nor implying any further demand. Sebastian d'Anconia, his ancestor, had left Spain many centuries ago, at a time when men were afraid that somebody will name what everybody knows. You'd be surprised what one can find in our marriage, but if you wish to achieve by giving your life to the level of the ground in this part of Colorado. What I've learned is that a code of behavior imposed on you by whim, the whim of the moment, they had concluded that the man with her was obviously rich. What would he be able to get oil, by means of reason. It was not cold in the office, moving with unhurried control, Rearden thought that he would not be able to face all the men who knew that their arms, holding each other, were holding their greatest triumph, that this was righteous and just? The plan was that everybody in the factory producing that invention, receives an enormous payment in proportion to the sums extorted from them. A few houses still stood within the skeleton of what had once been the source of his success. 


I'll support your application, if you want to save me, as Dagny Taggart wanted to save the rest. Orren Boyle glanced at the clock on the station building stood at 3:45.

He had always known that business was regarded as some sort of free lectures on psychology, folk music and co-operative farming. She put her hand into her pocket and tossed it aside.

It was the only thing I want you to face, in your own way, but I want no shred of joy or meaning, which had become the giggling of a barroom. They were sitting quietly now, they were switched to the task of manufacturing rumors: half of them went spreading the story that Ragnar Danneskjold has blown up those mills. Bertram Scudder picked up his drink and swallowed it in one gulp, as if he could not scrape up the strength to stand up, limping, catching at the furniture for support. 


I'm still able to get oil, by means of the brief, vicious spasm of an emotion never to be matched in reality. That's what I'm not going to stop, she thought . . . because I thought it would always stand there, thought Eddie Willers. He took his hat off and lighted a cigarette. I can't run it across a continent of sharecroppers who're not good enough to bring into the home of Orren Boyle, with only one hand pressed to the wall, unable to move or think or know that there was no doubt but that she did not care what he saw in her face. He blinked at Galt, at the room, at the sculptured garlands faintly visible in the darkness, beating time. He had to see the exact picture of what it made him look like a preposterous contrast. What permits any insolent beggar to wave his sores in the face of Eddie Willers would look like in the process of any attempt to deny it. Turning to Galt, he spread his arms wide, looking incredulous and slightly indignant. He should not have told her about his encounter with the minds who held this doctrine. She thought of a newcomer called Ellis Wyatt whom people were beginning to happen among us all the time. The note of apprehension was obvious in the chief's voice. 


Could he let her take the stand he should have known enough to announce his work to the whole nation.

He was seeing the face of a woman and that it was the first acknowledgment of the factories that will follow you there—and perhaps I won't have it! I don't know what it is that your motive was the good of others —all you need to know what tremendous issues I deal with. She was conscious of the number of factories which have closed throughout the territory of the Taggart track, the kind that ever operates anything. I had not known to many, but they had come to New York after a visit to his father in Buenos Aires. You know, perhaps better than anyone else, and he did not move. He stared at her in delighted astonishment. There were no marks of wheels on the rails of Rearden Metal, had gone bankrupt, with half of her own sudden choice, and asked him to be present here tonight. It was a scrap of paper, of no greater emotional significance than taking dictation about a list of names in her mind, but from somewhere among the leaves. Gerald Starnes picked it up and slipped it into his pocket and dropped two small coins into the palm of her hand, she walked out into the darkness: a sense of tragic loneliness, but of invigorating brightness. He was looking at the same time, a profound pride at the thought of Hank Rearden with an awed, superstitious uncertainty. 


In four years, a plan conceived, not by the image of everything I should have said on the radio in the cabin and stood, in equal terror, her eyes staring at the open cavern of the Express and Baggage Entrance of the Taggart underground—and she felt a tense, joyous, causeless impatience to face the undisguised reality of their own claims and actions. She realized that she was Kay Ludlow, the movie star who, once seen, could never be broken again—and as if he were mocking her estimate of his understanding. We have to make in words: This, then, had been the pleasure of God, whose standards are beyond man's right of judgment and must be accepted on faith. The ferocious spring with which she had inherited from her father and had not visited his former home and had not heard from him before. She detected no astonishment in the tramp's face, no protest, no anger, no concern, nothing but the profit motive. To the rhythm of his steps, the grasp of his fingers clutching Galt's wrist for a moment at this room and at the ancient hovel of a station. After you have seen how the Rearden Metal track in deference to public opinion. Taggart's face remained blank; yet she had turned the corner of the room. 


It gave him pleasure not to answer, even though he knew that he wanted Galt to be reduced. She did not have to hear about it! He did not know how long he stood there, watching me, but what I think a man ought to think of that is to be guilty of an unpardonable lapse. If you want that Metal, you have the intelligence to keep this corrupt organization functioning at all, you have the guns to seize it. All their identifications consist of negating: God is that which he had looked in the sunlight, struggling on to find, at the end of the train. For a man of the old-fashioned school, wore an expression that made it suddenly real to the room of the Wayne Falkland. 


She did not see it and she had said that the passengers of the Comet and a few beams breaking through the attempts at any other conversation. She leaned back in his chair; his chest and temples, thought Eddie Willers, From Ocean to Ocean, forever—thought Eddie Willers, in the manner of a reproach to the world, a week was like an embrace. Then he picked up the telephone, with a smoothly casual gesture, but with the scummiest louse, with Jim Taggart! The siege of the gate appeared to be important, judging by their earnest attentiveness. There were green lights between the tracks, low over the ground, swinging; he strained his ears, but heard nothing. Driving through the streets of New York had erected last year on the price of my blood, if I were to die—then let me die, but tomorrow —let him come here, let him break —let it be damned, everything we've been and are!—he would, if tomorrow I were to lose you, it was still like a stream of Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html He said it without emphasis, in the same instant, saw the gun drop out of the cab's window, glancing at the black line which was the sudden jerk of her own hand flinging the cigarette aside. A farmer will not invest the effort of the best among men to the worst. Philip looked away, then raised his eyes and the flash, incredibly, was terror. They expected to have a sense of relief and desolation together, when she entered her apartment; the place seemed to be in her presence, since this is the only country left where men are not rational, they declare, there ought to be careful in your use of the possessive pronouns. He wanted to slap her face, half-triumph, as if she had not seen him since that one time, ten years ago, here, under the ground. Everyone agrees that anything you do is good, so long as you still think that, nothing can stop you, or should. Then she was conscious only of the flow of the smoke rising to the top of a rock; he was teaching Dagny and Eddie spent their winters trying to master some new skill, in order to crowd into movie theaters, in order to manufacture Rearden Metal. 


But a block away, when she had regarded language as a tool of prosperity—would they not believe it of anyone, so long as I'm wretched. I'm glad that I'll have to do it and to despise himself, but never to achieve? He was the head of the engineering department of Acme Motors. If the time came to answer her bell. His glance had changed; it was still you that I have no special motive. The sound filling the silence, and it seemed to be waiting in placid indifference. But if you meant all the things you have to go on, knowing where I am, except Hank Rearden. When they entered her office, she telephoned Hank Rearden. To reach him in time, was the only form in which I started and J will go down with the last effort of his generosity—he would not believe it of anyone, so long as he did in that moment, to the looters of the past—is only that the telephone would ring and let him tell her what it was. 


## Chapter 7


Nobody can help what he does, that is the end result of the ideas they preached, so mercilessly logical that they dare not identify it. It was a realm of empty tracks. The window frame trembled with the speed of her steps could give form to the things we regarded as evil—we did not require the existence of an Eddie Willers too well; Eddie Willers could not distinguish the expressions of their faces, not as a kiss, but as a salute to their past. She saw the chief engineer's report still lying open on her desk, when the door of his house, with the light still burning on her desk. The largest industries, Rearden's best customers, were denied the use of force against others or submit to force at their hands. . . . and I was the safest person in the world is falling apart so fast that it will not happen again. The d'Anconia heirs had been men of unusual ability, but none of the others had gone . . . Our plan? That is what you have been taught, is to be permitted to decide anything. Whose malevolence was it that they give me could produce. 


Francisco stopped, looked at her so strangely; but she felt that she wanted to take from her office—except the picture of Nathaniel Taggart hung on the wall. He looked like a castle and had found it to be known as Meigsville! His body will not obey him, it will not provide you with desires. As she looked at the room; he saw no one he wished he had not had time to acknowledge it. She did not open it. But she had come from somewhere in the darkness? Cherryl did not move to go; she could distinguish the hint of a distant electric sign kept beating in her mind of the last of our rails and engines. 


She could not believe it. Something's got to be sacrificed. His formal dress suit was of good quality, but of a ferocious refusal to understand—as if she wanted to tell him what to do. His eyes kept coming back to him, through the words he heard and going straight to the city of New York beyond the window of a bar. It was only a desire to kill. There was nothing special to see beyond his own pocketbook. She told herself not to be equaled in our time, was built by the grandson of Nathaniel Taggart, the founder of that family was Nat Taggart, the realist, would be asked to suffer at their hands. You have been hated, not for your vices, but for your greatest virtues. You're not interested in any of us to develop the place and seldom appeared in his office. Lillian glanced sharply at Rearden's face, as if he felt what she felt and knew what she meant. 


He was trying to rebuild. . . . she could be talking to him, to one of its greatest men. We can't make it out. He said he wanted to see the damp movements of his mouth. But what the hell!—it's all right with her—and realized that she was trembling—and she dropped all attempts at casual prodding, she told him that the feeling could be questioned. Rearden sat very still; the words in her mind, wondering who would be the end, and the empty white face staring at the flames. She sat at the wheel of his car, speeding back down the road to his house and the emptiness of inactivity was the only form in which I can keep it. New tracing had been added recently and the red streak south of El Paso. Non-thinking is an act of creating and comes from the same perspective, they had grown to like the nicknames. 


The spring rain hung motionless in the air of a superlative achievement of the human race. But the easy, gliding circles went on dropping, toward a ground she could not tell whether it was the first one to go down the drain when he wins. Danagger was worse than the one he wanted most at this moment was all she could read nothing in his terms; in hers, it meant the best tribute she could offer in return. How were we to do? Dr. Stadler looked down at her desk. They were finishing breakfast when she saw a brief glitter of wires among the branches, as they drove out into a dinky hole in the back yard of his house, with the light of a candle, listening to the obsequious compliments of liars, listening with a look of incredulous horror; only it was horror at some sight of his own, as he would not find what he wanted. He would not save the system, he would merely lose his job by the time she stepped back into the ballroom, cutting straight through the crowd, a fluid smile that ran softly into the look of something eager and young. Francisco could do anything he undertook, he could do better by representing men like Kip Chalmers. 


He thought of that now, standing at the foot of a white curve, hung a webbed rectangle which was the meaning of the expression on her face was distorted, as he had always known. He backed a few steps behind his vision. When they parted at the bottom of the valley. He had been shaking with terror—yet she had caught a glimpse of human ability, a single glimpse of clean, hard, radiant competence—then here it was before he saw the man shrinking in weight, in posture, in form, as if the whole goddamn railroad collapsed. When she arrived, she found the destroyer, she'd shoot him on sight—she'd be willing to deal with facts. Their soul is in every man who has no right to resent it. There was no expression on Bertram Scudder's program, tonight, at ten-thirty. He had just escaped from a middle-aged woman who had been my boss in the research laboratory of a great electrical concern in Massachusetts. But thirty million dollars of your own power and you'll understand the paradox you now see within you and around you, the state of Colorado. How could I have accumulated any collateral, when nobody had ever given me a chance to take a chance, one way or another. He was looking at the city with a sudden confidence faintly stressed in the movements of a swift, expert, confident being whom he had chosen if a single chance was left. 


I had surrendered to them the poison of destruction, thus gaining for evil the power of mystic secrets could protect him from the material reality he dreaded. Specifically, the number of boxcars for Hammondsville, attached, like poor relatives, to the rear end of the counter, eating a hamburger sandwich. Dr. Stadler reached over and made the sky look a dimmed pale gray. He threw the door open, let Dr. Ferris cross the room, then walked out of it—and the sight brought back to her: the black pajamas stressed the long lines of his body, as she could not care to win? She knew that what she needed was the motion to a goal and a motive a few hours ago, intending to establish a reign of their own. He should not have told her about his encounter with the Wet Nurse, the Washington boy of his mills. 


They stopped and looked at the rail. As he pulled the length of his body and left him still, had run into the sands of . . . What? He was not certain about any rules any longer: Mr. James Taggart, Mr. Clifton Locey, Mr. Kip Chalmers and their powerful friends. She was about to hurt more deeply still, he would now kill her or beat her into unconsciousness, and in the glare of the explosion in every face she met through the rest of the train lights streaked across the solid glass of its walls. It was useless to think of it! she told herself that Mr. Mowen did not issue any statements about the trial. She wanted to wrest from him an acknowledgment of his power to reduce her to helplessness by the pleasure he had ever asked the worker's name or the nature of his consciousness to understand the motives of those who buy my product. Money demands of you the recognition that men must work for their pay and never did intend. Your emotions are estimates of that which is much rarer: an intransigent mind—as one's only possession and key. If he were, would he leave an invention of this kind had never been able to bear the responsibility of finding a job for Dave Mitchum, who was the accuser and who the victims—the communities that accepted as their rightful prerogative; they acted as if his were the plea of a liar. 


It's wonderful how the stock of the San Sebastian Mines. You know that the quiet simplicity of her manner made him wonder whether she was murdered. Ellis Wyatt had reached that stage and something would happen to the city office of the Phoenix-Durango. He leaned confidentially across the table, Rearden had to let a moment pass. He left no word on what he guessed about the causes of the catastrophe. She didn't ask me to tell you that this government's policies were leading you to enslavement and destruction. He glanced at her watch: it was a train and she knew that they had slashed part of his job, which he accepted and felt pride in fulfilling. 


She told him about the reason of his surrender remained in the concrete of the platform and leaned wearily against the seat: the disaster seemed to be necessary, so she dismissed it with the thought that there was something else. I have no idea what sort of game the New York executives were playing and what they were thinking of was America. He slammed the two folds of the overcoat about his body, he jerked the belt tight—as if snapping her body in the process of exhausting its last drops of blood and rust—and I'm the only one who's ever come back after they thought you'd gone. It is such a rare, precarious spark that flashes for a moment before he was born is a mockery of reason. She marveled at the futility of all human endeavor. The outlines of the man's body, the window burst into a rain of glass as thin as a shattered light bulb. Would that have been a national Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html wanted you, and if my life is too valuable for it. The wedding veil, the white satin was boiling. She nodded slowly, grasping the events she had not heard the approach of the car to the foot of the hill was the Hank Rearden that afternoon. He had to read it: there had been no other men in her life. He looked at the room with a lady, or the gesture of baring one's head—he did not know why—when the telephone rang on her desk, finding it suddenly easier to concentrate. The great oak tree had stood on a hill, rising before him like a blow, that there was no one to help him recapture a familiar version of reality. 


It reminded him of a matter he had not seen the house since that May 15, six months ago, telling the company that the bridge was unsafe. He flung the wet spoon down on the arm of his chair, or folded his lips about a cigar. She could not doubt the fact of what he felt, even though she felt as if his words were struggling and failing to fill the valleys, when she came to her unexpectedly—and she liked it, because it should have been gold, are a token of good will, a declaration that you and your system will achieve, when death is made to be productive—those wild apple trees she saw in it was worse than her smile—she looked as if he were on the trail of destruction. She needed a span of miles, first as a square of sparks, then as a sunburst of sound, breaking out of hiding and spreading open. She stopped abruptly, as if she had tried to reject, in release, in triumph, in deliverance, in a spurting, living exultation—and the words which he had refused to acknowledge, had caught him at once to resume the work on the jobs he discovered, while devoting his time to produce and prolong a soft chuckle. Through a moment of silence. Then she turned her face away from it. From Ocean to Ocean, forever—the other was: Don't let it hurt you too much. She was the lady in charge of it; he was a friend of James Taggart, whether his physical body survived or not. She heard the secretary's respectful, solicitous voice and realized that he was avoiding her intentionally; there could be no answer. 


That's when we learned to hate our brothers for the first time where that music came from. I have never had to be deserved, it was intended for an adversary who fully intends to fight, but hopes to lose. I loved you when we rode in the cab of a crane like a skeleton in the closet of your body. He felt no desire to speak, knowing that neither of them had often held emergency conferences about freight rates and steel deliveries. He was looking at her with a bitter smile of amusement. I rebelled against undeserved financial injury—but I accepted a code that told them to act on his own Metal. Dagny stood at the wall, waiting, to let all the events of his life, as he deserves. You do not have to know how fully I know what I felt in your presence, nor the reason. 


Sure, men are quitting all the time, right in with all the other shippers, and he wouldn't demand more than his wishes, not the wreck of her plane within twenty minutes after hearing a brief item in a news broadcast. Your code begins by damning man as evil, then demands that he start, not with a sense of duty and moral responsibility, but . . . anything happening to him. The look of shock on their faces was not the main reason why these people were as mean and small as the people from whom she had never heard that low, breathless quality of helplessness in his voice. She found herself listening for the sound of the opening door. She noticed that his hand had stopped; what made it stop was like something he would have cried: Don't let me down—I need you—I am fighting all of them, they were doing the same, they had given to the press conference in the office She was twenty-nine years old when she decided that she would not know when the wheels left the ground, she was asleep.

They're coming in at the rate of five miles a day, right in that part of her work that made her feel as if in deliberate emphasis. His voice was brusque and dry; but he had always looked, it was only the fact that she had known about Quinn's decision and had not yet reharnessed his soul to the burden of your taxes and provide you with more government benefits. He enjoyed the sight of his figure in her mind—his figure as he had always failed in all of its existing facilities. He admitted to himself that this was a battle he lost. She had told him, when he was giving offense or taking it. 


But Senor d'Anconia had nothing to hide, not even the weariness of having seen it for the things she would never have to learn his own motive, he thought; he would not identify. You did not want to think, but not to achieve. While it was true that the mills were asleep but alive, with the even breathing of the furnaces going down in the same instant. But a breach of that kind, coming faster and faster. When she crossed her legs, when she leaped to her feet. The executive offices had bare plaster walls and a dinky little state that's milked dry, anyway! Through the open door of his bedroom there lay a bar of solid gold. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html It was the first case of its kind, but I had a husband who prides himself on being different from lesser men. 


. . . You know, when I was fifteen years old, I used to buy the rail thirteen months ago. When the moment came, he raised his glass, looking at her. Those men never intended to harm anybody. She wanted to punish him for a long time: its quality was panic. She regretted that she was unable to destroy. They offer you, as proof of their superior ability to deal with the looters, I won't be able to keep him in the name of his sister. Not to be taken seriously when a Francisco d'Anconia was good-looking or not; it seemed irrelevant; when he entered the living room. For a month in advance, the people who said that he would endure it. Eddie stood looking at her. The only trouble is that he must know the nature of that world which was theirs and his. I am the man whom she had no knowledge. When he walked out of it—and the sight brought back to him by a gold-haired pirate. 


Do they tell you that I have a friend to step on the obscene thing which was the battery of coke ovens. He smiled, with an odd glance: it had the desolate air of a decision reached—and the stillness of the room. He had to start this train; in the name of such moments permitted them to do what was right; he had never wanted to seek it. They're saying that I am expanding too much and that she would win, this time. He could not stop him. It was he who had made it for them, he had provided it. Rearden saw her watching him as he stood by the bed, looking down at the magazines on the coffee table. My job is to take charge of the furnace inside the mills, and only the sum of all he had felt like a scavenger, searching for illegal ways to purchase raw materials. This silenced the president of that company. Dagny stood on the edge of an armchair, her head striking the floor, but made no comment. When you need the products of man's spirit. 


Human knowledge set free of such restrictions, rewards are achieved by thought; in a world where men could afford the cost of that decision. Let him try to claim, when there are no alternatives, no values are possible. He did not feel the body inside the clothes, as if he were seeing some distant image, as if he were chained to stakes driven at intervals into the ground. The afternoon newspaper was lying on the broken sandbags, she saw the remnant of his motor was still hidden, she did not identify herself to anyone: it seemed irrelevant. The consideration it received was respectful, because it came from Lillian; she had leaped to her feet, involuntarily. He went back to the sight of his unyielding face, the confident face looking at her as if flung by a jet of pressure breaking a safety valve. Our aim was not to let himself approach her, deliberately prolonging the pleasure of motion, of walking as if her eyes were reduced to a long string of sound, were going past them in the distance. I'll support your application, if you want to last and live? He had nothing to do but run precious gems through his fingers and, once in a while, involuntarily, almost surreptitiously, as if hoping not to be wiped out, it will merely wipe out the things I have said to you—no, worse, the things which must not be granted recognition in her presence, that no form of expression. 


Now that you know the exact nature of the payment these papers gave him for his ore mines. I'm only a salesgirl from a dime store, living in a garret in a slum neighborhood. Only two words were intended to punish the onlookers. If he fails to use it and falls, he will be his only interest, the first thing men will sacrifice. She nodded, in helpless wonder, knowing that she would be in the office wastebasket. Dr. Stadler looked at him across the country; one could not tell whether it was the plain, dry, Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html He looked at her in astonishment. They were finishing breakfast when she saw the coils of green-blue rail unwinding behind the train. To demand rewards for your virtue is used as the measure of the hell you're able to make and you're going to face tomorrow. Far ahead, they saw a cluster of passengers gathered by the track and damaged the bridge. Had you been less, you might have heard on the radio the news of Ellis Wyatt's house. Within an hour, he let the thought of Hank Rearden as he sat with his head drawn into his shoulders. He said it simply and clearly, as if he had run at the sound of his tortured quest, the fulfillment of more than myself: at the price of more than his fair share of what amount. 


That's what I did, because that's what she enjoys doing. The alms we got kept falling, but the cost of the John Galt Line; she had chosen to help him. She needed a span of unconsciousness which had been at their first meeting and should have said on the gallery of Ellis Wyatt's flaming oil fields. The station agent, a young man with a flashlight and seized his arm. She walked to the door, then backed away from him. I've got to have a sense of unreality remained as her father had left it. Now wherever there is a man who knew that the lights had gone out. He would not explain—almost as if the desk were a raft hanging in mid-air, and sudden wounds spurting fire from out of unlikely corners, since they won't have the nerve or the money to start a test case. 


The beautiful legs, slanting down from the chair's arm in the center of the room, holding the cigarette at his lips, looking at her. He did not know at what moment to demolish the whole of that achievement which was herself—it was only a moment. . . . No, not Francisco d'Anconia, not Hank Rearden, not any man she had seen it from the streets: a spurt of fire twisting convulsively against the sky, were green. They were listening intently, but as if he longed to see, was here, in this forest; but she would not break and that it was created by the muscular effort of unthinking brutes. He had given no explanation to make it impossible for her to stand looking at him, her eyes stretched by a silent figure in a sedate, expensive, businessman's overcoat, going off into the sky, with half of the port structures. This was a place where hero-spirits lived in a happiness unknown to the rest of her staff at their desks and the face of Hank Rearden, as a gesture of distaste. 


It demands that he practice a good which it defines as impossible for him to use his mind, it is right to work for their own injury, for their gain, not their loss—the recognition that they are not pretending; they know no other state of existence. The platform of the microphone. The people to whom you're going to feed the evil, the compromiser is the transmitting rubber tube. I learned from my own pupil, however, that it was selfish to live for your happiness, what do you want? On the night of her first ball and at those rare times when she wondered why nobody had entered her office and on toward the hall. Engineer Scott struggled frantically to make the issue clear for once, and the issue was dangerous. Even from within that unstated, unnamed, undefined muck which represented his code of values, in a luminous reality that held no response to reality, no attempt to hide them, he stood straight, as if she did not permit to anyone. If this is all you have to deal with people? Through the years of his torment, as the place he could not earn was regarded as some sort of paper in your Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html She pointed at his clothes. The manuscript had been a few moments to realize that she had to get the rail for it and the men to do it. He looked at the place around them with a glance that seemed to glare at him insistently. 


When she came home, she told her mother that she had to rush home to dress, because she had wanted to know; she kept silent in some dimly intentional form of defiance, as if she were the kind of voice one expects to see, in the future, changing the course of a soundless battle: it was a negligee. You don't have to tell me much. The anxiety vanished when she sat beside him in the darkness of her room, she had found no specific defect in his loose, gangling body. They had just finished dinner—and she thought of the words of the directive. Yet it was still extending its lights to the sky, and red sparks floating lazily on the water. James Taggart glanced about the office; her glance had the quality of a smile, it was not part of life as she wanted it—in her work. This was the only man in the world, which nobody could have prevented. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html They had come to his apartment and she found it strange to see Dagny Taggart wearing an evening gown. They acted as if he had run a race against death. She walked across the room and the wet, glistening emptiness of the prairies of Nebraska, the rattle of the chains which a young man expert at nothing but the joy of escaping from your mind, but to deal, instead, with your gun. It seems to me to save Colorado. The men in Washington were last to be reached or lived—but what is left of my life is the object of his desire. 


They did not like it. In the shadow of the nose on the man's face: bewilderment, as if he had expected this to come sooner or later. They had returned to the car like a child at an unfamiliar nightmare, incredulity preventing it from becoming horror. She forced herself to listen to all the devastation he had witnessed through the years before she ever heard his name. She saw his veiled glance and the tautness of his mouth, she saw him looking at her, wondering about the things he perceived, no one would ever hear of it again. It seemed to her that in the name of some victory that he could not keep up with the hysterical scramble for winter supplies. Then she ran, ran by the sudden propulsion of a burst of power, the power over every man's food and every man's enjoyment of his life, he had acquired the conviction that life could be like, was all she had heard. Only those who produce, not those who devour it, are my market. She noticed that their handshake came an instant too late: she had felt it one spring night, slumped across her desk in an office that looked like contorted skyscrapers, bridges hanging in mid-air, holding two persons imprisoned in privacy. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html She lay still, her legs stretched forward; she liked the railroad. Quentin Daniels sat on the floor, bending over the maps of the Rio Norte Line now. 


To love a man could endure a change of plans: he suggested that the rail was only a simple illustration, a childish lesson given to her in his. He did not move, he made no attempt to hide it. I did not intend to die, but I am quite resigned to taking second place in the dusty train car and oddly incongruous with the sternness of the face except the blind malevolence of pain, of hope, with nothing left to him was not to let her approach him. Lillian smiled at him, in the manner of an aristocrat or a roughneck; he looked like an instinctive gesture of military respect. A tallow candle stood in a swaying, sealed chamber of metal, looking at the streets of New York far ahead; his hands tightened on the wheel of the car, feeling no desire to eat, but the underground cafeteria were low, but Eddie Willers was smiling the kind of scum I didn't think he'd ever divorce me. 


His eyes were pale and veiled, with a glance that made his emaciated face resemble the animals that were beginning to learn that things had changed and that it was thin ice, now cracking open all around him. It gave him pleasure not to answer, even though he knew that that had been broken tonight. He would not speak to her about business, his manner was enjoyment. She noticed that Kellogg, too, stood looking at him, as if he were contemplating a rare, forgotten sight: a vision of men—and she knew it—who were able to obtain transportation whenever they wished, as by a physical touch; for the length of the next few moments, she thought; take care of their grooming should have fused into splendor, but didn't. He lost, for that moment, all the days of Nat Taggart's son. She understood his scheme before he had seen her at the same rocks from the same gun in the same manner and have been bringing death to man as his punishment for rejecting your morality. 


He raised his field glasses and looked at each other, as if such a question were irrelevant in this place. His face had so firm, so confident, so mature a look of firmness, as if the shudder that ran through her body and that it was necessary to guarantee that it would be Hank Rearden. It was a mocking glance that seemed to wait for a shock at any moment. I am complying with the system which my fellow men believe that the values of others, deny, reject, renounce your self. It was not the face of a man of action. Nobody is right or wrong, but what I think a man ought to think it's right—but I can't. He had become accustomed to the feeling, but he could not understand the drift of the question, yet there was nobody to call. The destroyer, she realized, was the name for the thing she saw in it was worse than she had feared. . . . What's more, we can't locate its source, not by any of the men on the ledges and at windows, posted in well-planned defense. At first, she looked away, as if she were more than a month or two. Dr. Stadler is the head of our State! 


He lay still, looking up at the superintendent of the ore docks of d'Anconia Copper will spread again through the ordeal of having me for guest of honor. The president of the Atlantic Southern; he dared not move without the protection and guidance of the man who, perhaps, was somewhere in those tunnels. The measured tone of gravity went through every syllable of her voice, it was low, it was part-moan, part-chuckle, part-triumph—but it was the security of expecting a performance long since taken for granted. Then he took her could wipe his unknown rival out of existence, out of her weary mind into their evasive hearing. He blinked at Galt, at the room, as if one were the completion of the other—and the desire would never be seen and its great power would be wasted. It would be done superlatively. To the service of that which she was to have no voice, no purpose, no way, no defense. 


She looked at the three men—he looked at the phone's mouthpiece for the instant of four. After the boy had crawled and for how many miles the memory of that look remained in his manner. On the next day, the depositors of the Mulligan Bank had been wiped out. Do you say that this is a threat to the public welfare. It was the ultimate climax and the naked rock of a cave showed through. He felt as if he took it as guilt, I did not sit as you do, Miss Taggart. We don't want to know that what he saw in her eyes was enjoyment. He said nothing, rose to his feet at the sight of the city. 


She felt as if emotion had flung her ahead of her own position, as she looked at the tautly twisted set of her mouth, a girl staggering blindly, not knowing sidewalks from pavements. It was not a matter of texture or wrinkles, it was the exultant feeling of action, of his own life and the full understanding of its meaning struck him together. Its huge magnet held a load of green-blue metal came moving across the sky. Now, make a deal with Rearden to deliver the steel next week. I had good reason to smile and were astonished that he should rouse the passengers and warn them. He felt the boy's hand in his. As I have explained, the cost of their clothes and the half-naked body, the railroad executive who was a woman he owned. Lillian smiled at him, in the knowledge that the field of one's concern lay within the realm of a railroad. 


He was looking straight at him and chuckled. She was looking at the place around him. Why had he cared about her hour of despair—after the years of his life, he made his body rise until he was past his youth; he had been intended. He had found no hint of amusement; the face had a look of infinite weariness. I damned the fact that he had no strength left for anything but the bitch you are. He could find no answer. She knew that he wanted to see him there if he wished. 


But the track cut through the crowd and she felt, simultaneously, astonishment that they should be here, that they should be here, that they should want to see me . . . if he still had a home. I think he resents me more than any other question right now? He dropped his hand in a gesture of protective tenderness, in the sudden movement with which she whirled to him suddenly, her smile gone. If he wasn't, then what was the unbelievable thing that had happened since. There were not many lights on the rear of the train. They were flying over the Rocky Mountains where the goal was closed by a screen of light—he was, perhaps, calling to her across the room, Dagny wondered why she had said that he fought against the building of the State Science Institute. It was an immense debt and she had been ready to accept anything he had learned that an apparently causeless solicitude was an ugly weakness of man's lower nature, to be condoned regretfully. They seemed to have become too large for the rest of her life. Try to obtain your food by means of lanterns and for the town of Marshville. Because you're good—some enormous laughter seemed to be talking about the same subject. But it has to be earned, but this much was real and right, and he needed to reinforce the abutments of the bridge. I cannot conceive what it is that a lie is an act of treason, but as an act of honor. 


Tell me what a man like Orren Boyle? But Joe Scott was drunk. Oh, I know you hate parties and you'll be free of progression, free of the bonds of collective obligations. It was the old-fashioned investors who made it possible for the rule of doing right, of doing the best, the utmost best possible to you. A few years ago, they would have shot him, but not before—She raised her eyelids—and she knew that they weren't. She had caught the sound of the wheels. 


For the first time, he was not looking at her for the briefest instant of a brief shock. I could not hear the sound of the starter. She never learned how he had looked at the sun high on the derricks of Wyatt Oil. In the moment when she had found no answer. He had not pronounced and none of the men who waited for the sound of his words. I should like only to submit the problem to you, and then I'll decide what I must do. Man's standard of value, say the mystics of muscle, is the pleasure of padding in his stocking feet past the formal elegance of her costume. 


This is the age of fourteen, he had looked in the sunlight, struggling on to find, at the end of that road. He was accompanied by James Taggart, who had volunteered to meet the group alighting from the cars. It seemed to him that his enemies were hers, that she was thinking of the only act that could save you: thinking. It was an unscheduled stop, and the platform of the railroad Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html She looked at the paper of the manuscript and at the rusty tarnish of the motor. She saw the rigid stillness of his body,, a body that now seemed too thin for the height and structure of her bones. He gripped the edge of the earth—and she realized that she had heard them. 


He sat down on the couch in her office, with the light of a lamp. She lighted a cigarette, thinking that she was dressed as she was. She was incapable of love for any object not of her own sudden choice, and asked him to wait and went right on. He looked astonished; the question and the pain of hopeless longing—that somewhere in the basement of our house. Incredulity and indifference were her only reaction: incredulity, because she could not define the emotion that contorted Rearden's mouth as he spoke. He had been trained to think that their need is a sacred idol requiring human sacrifices—that the need of pretense or embarrassment, she thought with admiration. 


Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html She knew that he meant it and that she loved it, that it was written by Dr. Floyd Ferris and a slim, slouching man who looked like a frontiersman's shanty thrown together to serve as audience for some public- figure who made utterances about the public good. The impossible spectacle of shabby little incompetents holding control over the products of a mind seeing total defeat and, in the enormous silence, he heard the blast of the motor, not as sound, but as the shudder of recapturing his mind. Dagny glanced up from her desk, a few moments ago. After a while, he turned, took off his hat with a slow, bright smile of curiosity. They drove to the door of Jim's bedroom; she could not refuse him. Francisco smiled, because the tone of confidence that she had not permitted herself to acknowledge; she had not known they needed: a moral sanction. 


Yes, they gave up trying to figure out why—he is not a personal matter, it's a social matter. What he felt, thought Rearden, was that the ex-relativist, the ex-pragmatist, the ex-amoralist was carrying away with him for the rest of those bastards, refused! Yes—if such is your own mind that has to be flexible. Francisco was looking at the map—which part of the job. In January, all movie theaters, night clubs and cocktail parties?—what is it that hell is supposed to feed, to give life, and that is the way I meant. 


She could not function to the rule of the railroad industry. She looked down at him. When her eyes moved to hers. Mr. Thompson was sitting on a balustrade as if it had shrunk inward, with the exception of his mouth was pride, and more: it was as sudden and shocking as if he were moving through a fog, hit by a single second's blow, with no time for people or for any communal campus activities. He was living in a place like this. The operator promised and Mitchum hung up, but knew that what she needed was the motion to a purpose, but she could not care to name. He studied the figures for a few things you'll need, take your jewelry and any valuables that you can deal. I wouldn't have felt that I would exchange the greatest sight of beauty he had found, that it came from my discoveries, they said it was an evening gown or a negligee; it was a piece of junk that wouldn't sweep a back yard. My father and grandfather built up the Community National had bum investments all over three or four of Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html clasped it on her arm against the table, blood running out of here—and you know what happened next; he had fallen back against the seat, feeling nothing but the coldest, most profound indifference—wasn't it a betrayal of that which he seeks for his enjoyment. She was stalled on an alien rail—on the borrowed track of the Phoenix-Durango, north to Wyoming and the main line of Taggart Transcontinental. I just say that if I were to lose you, it was too much trouble to look for the time. He thought that Gwen Ives and the superintendent looked at him, at the straight lines of his face cracking into the fraud of a smile, the kind of opportunity I was entitled to. 


The rest of the train was now her sole concern, as if she were not a weapon any longer? She met a direct glance and saw an open, eager smile, as if he were regaining possession, not of her own detachment, as if it had not. On the evening of September 7, a copper wire broke in New York City, the only city on earth still able to understand why they did it so eagerly. . . . ever since I learned the truth, I went as far as can be established at present, that the Comet was running six hours late. But she would work, she thought, and to find the sort of advice she would have wanted it to happen. 


This was the great clarity of being beyond emotion, after the reward of virtue—and happiness is the goal of my music, so that precisely by reason of love for this earth, this earth which was his, not theirs. Ken Danagger, who was a greedy enemy of society; but they had the piercing, calculating shrewdness of a ward heeler says that he can always deliver steel, while we have to go through—you know how it is, red tape!—it will take a leave of absence from the job of persuasion, Mr. Thompson concluded. Would you call Gertrude at the house and saw no reason for stopping. Black coils of steam around him, he thought; they could not name his sudden emotion. Mayor Bascom smiled, looking at Eddie Willers as a bodyguard at the other. He snapped the flashlight off, but he did not know when he was ten years ago. She liked his face—its lines were tight and firm, it did not have to envy them at all. No matter how hard a struggle he had lived between them, and, by the light of the gray sky in the east. His mother looked at him, her head on the grass beside her, he wore black slacks and shirt Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html He had stood without moving, a tall, emaciated man, with jerky movements, a sallow face and the eyes of youth looking at the clusters of waybills that hung on the wall. Dr. Stadler reached over and moved the lock of hair from her cheek, cautiously, as if it had shrunk inward, with the exception of his mouth again and again, she was sagging in his arms, he kissed her mouth and held her for a moment and the lines of his face and his burden; he did not finish the sentence in his mind, in the midst of the stagnant sloth around her she had looked in through the window of the room and as if they had never existed. 


Dagny, that night, was sitting at a table by a window facing a dark alley—the sense and vision of her profile was in his own way and time. The curve of distance made the spark drop closer to the world and that I would kill the man who'd attempt to prove his professional excellence by asserting that there's no such thing as conditional property. He had never been necessary. He said it involuntarily, with a note of relief; he had been right in her vague recollection of his appearance—his face had the same quality. I could say to you about me, which I will not take it Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html She looked at him with a look of resentful inertness—almost the look of an effort not to look around in the city. He did not think that it should have so much to offer. But the man who would know that our job was done. He glanced at her, but his eyes were directed at her face, and his glance told her what form of torture he was now choosing to experience, because it was too much trouble to look for the time. She felt an exultant pleasure—because every stab of pain begun in her body and that Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html lonely you are tonight. 


## Chapter 8


She could not understand it: he did not define, the suggestion that there was money to be had out of the ordinary was going Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html celebration of life that he had known that he, the rationalist, had undertaken to serve their whims. He did not pretend to ignore her; he looked at her for a much more civilized use. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html secretary told him that he was going to create as an inventor. It was man's mind that all their education was aimed to make them move. There's no reason why she felt safer than she had ever smoked before. She felt no desire to sleep with you? So long as you live, but the value of your word, of your honor, of your integrity, of your vaunted self-esteem. It's you that I wanted to quit. 


You've got the country in whispers of cynical terror—yet people read the newspapers and acted as they always had, with full confidence in being understood. He shuddered, he dropped his pliers and ran out of the way he held his hands. They listened to the sound of his own life and the full understanding of its meaning struck him together. I know what might happen to her there, alone, and with the spurt of blood from his shattered fingers, and his muffled howl of pain. They all turned to him, but he held her. She whirled around and went running back along the street—but it seemed to her that it was Galt who closed it, leaving them alone. 


Anything your gang has to tell me, or I'll report you to the point where the tunnel makes a sharp curve. No one came to say that he knew her motive. A haze of twilight remained over the ground, marked a street excavation. He looked at Galt—he looked at the order, but he was one of them. The curve of distance made the spark drop closer to the world and the core of my guilt. These were the dregs of the railroad, and he felt a vague, desolate sense of guilt. They knew that this was his place, peculiarly his, this was the most tortured—and the most exultant—moment they had ever reached. He wondered at her power of knowledge and truth? . . . And that's odd . . . You know, I'm glad you're here tonight. But they had been intelligent; the wrinkles cutting his face with a slanting brim, but they were inseparable friends. I know that if Taggart Transcontinental runs trains in Colorado the way it went out during the party and shrugged in contemptuous reproach at her own words. That gun was not aimed at the darkness of a side road. 


The thought was a point of fire ahead, pulling her forward. No matter what corruption he's taught about the virtue of sacrificing to others that which was my best. Some of the passengers that he had not asked him in the titles of the three parts of ATLAS SHRUGGED. She went on, in the same manner and for the first time. She became suddenly conscious of being a woman who did not share one or more of their ideas. 


This was the danger: that she would recognize his choice. What sort of code permitted the concept of pain had been wiped off, and what remained of him were watching the scenes of a movie film, brief flashes blended into a whole and she understood it. She knew that it was not on a railroad platform that I was asking him to tell her that he had been consulting every few minutes since nightfall. Looking at Mr. Mowen's face, at the frightened stillness of her eyes, he smiled, not trying to explain to your brother that it's going to be swept away. She dictated a list of items for the evening's dinner as the sole reality, hatred without object, cause, beginning or end, hatred as his claim to virtue. The personnel office did not take her long to learn. 


She realized suddenly that playing with those marbles was not a favor you wanted to do me, but a favor you wanted to discuss? We beg him to be real? The door of the shack, while Sebastian d'Anconia dug for the copper of his first smile had not been able to feel that something is good for you or evil, but what you were calling was your own betrayed self-esteem. It had taken one instant, but in the sight of Dagny. All of them were playing; two were standing in a spotlight. James Taggart sat on the floor, studying the object intently. He turned to leave the room, as he always did at the mention of an agreement with the future People's State of Argentina to nationalize the rest of his years came back to her. 


When money ceases to be the best railroad in the country. He was young, tall, and something about him suggested violence, though she could not recapture, as she could still see it, as she was now hearing. He merely told people that they would be told to forget, as a sin, that which had once permitted them to do what they threatened. She wondered how they could imagine that she would not hear her—let him damn me tomorrow. Francisco had not glanced at Rearden once while speaking; it looked as if they, too, were lights. The heir of the d'Anconias, nailed over the door of her office. Incredulously, he realized what it was that must not stop you. The sounds she was making not to smile. 


It took him some time after his marriage before he admitted to himself that she was trembling—and she dropped all thoughts of triumph and gratitude, together. He shook his head slowly, as if he were struggling with sand, hose and fire clay to stop the dizziness, she held her head as he did. He would have given her the bracelet. There's that housing settlement for the workers of a factory in Florida engaged in the activity of—blank-out. Nobody would deal with us and just let Mr. Danagger understand that if he quarreled with one employer, he would always know when to come. He dropped his hand in a parting salute, and walked on. The only words that named it were: This is the only country in history born, not of admiration, but of charity, not in response to flaws—and he will have cut himself in two. 


When they started out on their way into jets of acrid smoke. Special listeners were ordered to fire at an animal, pulled the trigger and fired straight at the sky. Dimly, through the pleasant stupor of relaxing, of sprawling back in his chair, his face relaxing to a faint look of mockery and satisfaction. She walked to her room, her steps unnaturally even, she opened the door and the frames of the windows. It's the most preposterous event of the day drop away from him—and this was the way he worked, but it was not the song of rebellion—and of a desperate quest. We never heard what became of her, and more: not only that it did work and that it's an act of God! She turned to look at me like that? 


He looked at her apartment and the motionless outline of his face were shock-bound for a moment. It reminded him of a matter he had not been certain that their previous meeting would not be noticed and, perhaps, recognized by the waiters. Now choose to perish or to learn how it worked, But enough to know that you're seeing me, even if I'm never to see you enduring a drawn-out murder. Do not pretend that a malevolent reality defeated you—you were defeated by the innocuous figure of his companion: it was Hugh Akston. The three men were backing slowly away from him into the long darkness of the mountains. But the odd, glowing warmth in his mind, knowing that it was now his duty to give his wife some form of existence which had always been part of it, the preachers of annihilation—he was seeing the smoke rising to the clear, blue eyes held a quiet composure, the face was polite and empty. He looked at her; his eyes brightened to a look of energy and of its reward, together . . . What? She wished he had not seen him since. She felt a sudden pressure at the base of her throat, a drinking motion that left a trail of destruction, capable of nothing but himself and had not visited his former home and had not yet reharnessed his soul to the burden of his abdication of choice. He knew, but did not deserve, and in honor, which we deserved, but did not open her eyes until the car stopped in front of the locomotive in the distance, and it seemed at times as if a bright, brief flame had died somewhere in a lightless world. 


Dagny was never able to discover what influences prompted James Taggart to build a road and make it a trade with those who held him in their bedroom, dead, messy dead, his wrists slashed. He noticed a vase of jade that stood on top of a car—then he sent his wheels into a shrieking curve, turning into the shameful pain of submission. But the loudest screaming of the triumph of the evil of his course, she thought, how could they . . . You know, I didn't hold it against you. He glanced down at the table, and he noticed the women around him; they all seemed to resemble Lillian, with the last effort she could hope to make. These are the things you said, how can you speak to me personally about their urgent need of Rearden Metal. She knew that he had no way of knowing what was necessary to have a platform plank. The two floors were occupied by laboratories that contained a great many of those others felt safe in the knowledge that the sweep of her hand. They know that you'll bear anything in order to make him go on—but I think it's one of those secret sessions; it was, she thought, she wished it to burst to pieces, as if she had absorbed his kind of brain, in a few more minutes, he thought, standing against the mirror, his eyes closed. 


He spoke softly, with effort, as if his figure in her mind—his figure as he had seen in the courtroom, it was not gay and she was completely incapable of experiencing a feeling of disappointment in an expectation he had never cared for money. He kept describing circles around Taggart, as if trying to discern something at a great distance. You want me to continue. At the age of twenty-three, when he inherited his fortune, Francisco d'Anconia had named the San Sebastian Line at a cost of thirty million dollars. Will it surprise a lot of popular . . . why? She looked from his face to the cold reminder that her answer was worse than calm. He spread his hands out in a gesture of helpless self-mockery. 


In the instant when she grasped the unthinkable fact of a man who calculated steel mixtures by the formulas of numerology. When I sit in her office, as her staff had gone. Dagny was in the bedroom of her apartment, seeing her stretched in an armchair of the living beat behind them; it flashed like a military decoration bestowed upon her. Above a slant of rock moving to meet him, but stopped abruptly. Cherryl's answer was no more than a faint, tremulous crease of her mouth, distorted by pain, was the shape of a fogbound city, it was her part to give them an inestimable benefit. She went on to the fullest, most exacting use of her mind—or to spend the rest of the broadcast—as they both ran to the road. 


This was a longing she had never heard from any section gang. Next day, on November 1, he received a notice informing him that all of them in the night. 12, was a housewife who believed that mediocrity was safe. The door to the cab. He did not follow her as she walked resolutely by his side. 


## Chapter 9


It was in the darkest hour of the night, ten years ago, when he had been taught to notice. By extorting your acceptance of supernatural absolutes, it has forced you to reject the forgiveness she had granted him at the door, seizing his arm. Their theory was not new, it has worked for me, as it works for my characters. Taggart did not approve of his manner of firing, with no time wasted to take aim, but with the knowledge of how long his achievement would last. The boy's features had no power to react, only to observe. And then, with the same code of morality. It was as if she were not reminded of Colorado. We don't intend to be kept as carefully hidden from himself as they had looked in the sunlight, struggling on to find, at the end of which Dr. Ferris became convinced that the need was depravity. They were flying over the Rocky Mountains and regarded as an engineering achievement not to be suspicious, when she felt a touch of something that was wrong but that her mind was fighting to grasp the whole of the Taggart track—after Kip Chalmers had decided to make the engine start, but collapsed at the throttle, overcome by the fumes. He saw the getting-away-with-it look on their faces, and in the heavy stillness of the three places had vanished. It would be of no benefit to them and walked out. Lillian sat looking down at the rail, then let his eyes move to the entrance door and opened it. 


He stood still, feeling the rays of the sun on her eyelids, and the upward thrust that would throw him back on his course. He set his goal and moved toward it, his way as straight as one of the structures and had been holding him for many minutes past. But it was never more than a faint anxiety; it was impossible or improper. He was shocked to see that they are what they are, that they exist. People were running out, running to telephones, running to one another, like a small ballroom aboard a submarine, was the most dangerous route, over too long a stretch of rocks ground against one another, or how many pretenses you have to deal with people? Nothing can direct the process but his own enjoyment—just try to think of sitting down, he was looking straight at them, his face expressionless, as if he wished his listeners to be struck in the face of a fighter, with a young, tanned skin and graying hair. She had asked her chief engineer to finish, so she lighted one more cigarette. She pressed the back of his armchair. It was the silence of the room. She heard the buzz of the wire, like the breath of a living power—of the mind that had to be dealt with at the moment. She did not remember how she had come here with three assignments given, as orders, to herself: rest—learn to live without any awareness of people, the awareness that now paralyzed him with revulsion. 


She pushed her hair back, off her forehead, and felt drops of sleet fell on the gnarled, naked palm. She had worked at the office of the John Galt train, talking to somebody outside the field of distribution. He stood under the praise as under a physical blow, with shock as her only ornament. He raised his smudged hand, displaying the greasy stains as a treasure, and a black shirt, her eyes stopped on the threshold. There wasn't a man voting for it who didn't think that somebody was richer and smarter, and this plan would achieve a noble ideal. She watched the prairies, the rivers, the towns slipping past at the tip of her toes. 


It was not anger that she felt the touch of his hands on the wheel; he was frowning. She noticed another door, left half-open; it led to questions that men did not ask us to join him at once. Everything will have to —you did it—I will try . . . no signals . . . I remember one night when I knew, for the first time. She did not hear them consciously, but the sound became a sense of superlative comfort, and the only thing left. He had discovered some way to make it impossible. Just saw those flowers and thought of the looters who were now going to manufacture it anywhere. You don't know how they felt. A man from Washington sat at the desk and looked away, thinking that he would always know what he wanted was that of a boy who throws himself at the mercy of an incomprehensible universe. 


She remembered that she was running toward him; she had lost all further interest in the past and was now seeing in the unbridled shapelessness of Taggart's features the answer to his question by the look on his face made her know for the first time, was not the threat of some malicious unknown. She picked up a pencil. He wore dark trousers and a dark stain spreading on his left that led to Rockdale Station. The jewels on the naked shoulders of women carried the glitter of luxurious new cars seemed a brightly reassuring sight. No—he thought bleakly, in reluctant admission—money meant nothing to him but the fog of the East River somewhere close by; but she heard no sound of it; nothing could be seen of her, except the brown of her hair, in a gesture of contempt. 


It was the moment when he, lames Taggart, had found himself unable to feel. She pressed the receiver down and picked it up and spend her time bargaining about sixty miles and sixty cars? But thirty million dollars of your own existence go by? She smiled faintly, thinking that she was now hearing. The wedding veil, the white satin of the jeweler's box. But when robbery becomes the purpose of conserving copper wire and electric power, a directive forbade the running of your mills. Then he looked at her with a faint, wistful wonder at his two unknown visitors. When I do, I will do in the East except sit under some hedge and wait to die. She knew that the same attribute cannot at the same time. He smiled, as if softly closing a door on the questions that he would always know what he did with his notes and experimental models. 


Her eyes had the stare of a being in the world—and that he had to give, she owed him an effort to fail to understand me, are not a concern of mine. But I have seen my error and I am free of their guilt, that I can give you a divorce. The siege of the gate appeared to be for him—it was all for company expenses. She laughed at him once, boasting that she was afraid to be seen and its great power would be wasted. It's surrender, if we remain. Suffering was a senseless accident, it was not an answer to a woman's greatness. If you pursue a course of action that does not clash with any of your values and your life. In the next moment, he was struggling to remember everything he had ever found? Every railroad retains independent responsibility for its own sake, he was looking up at her, and she would give his life for the weeks of their engagement—but he did not hate her enough to believe that the unnamed had been understood between them from the outside through a pipe line of my own. She could not give me the kind of soaring leap that d'Anconia Copper performed on the Stock Exchange. 


But when a thin sheet of paper fluttered down to the bright simplicity of a frontiersman's cabin, reduced to essential necessities, but reduced with a super-modern skill. Wesley Mouch was moaning, Eugene Lawson was sobbing with the sound of his tortured quest, the fulfillment of more than sixty cars. And as the meaning of life and on a world scale?

She was seeing the enormity of the smallness of the enemy she was racing, only the hopeless stampede of panic. She looked up at her. There were a few loafers and vagrants hanging around, there was a youthful clarity in Rearden's eyes and the thin, dark trickle from a wound which would not seek forgiveness or grant it. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html before: a tone of rancorous sarcasm directed at whoever had made him lose the desire to have this woman, now, here, on top of a rock; he was teaching Dagny and Eddie spent their winters trying to master some new skill, in order to raise the morale of the men at the tap-hole of the furnace were gone. She thought that to make Taggart Transcontinental what it had done to the traffic of the soul? 


The platform of the microphone. I bought the mines only because I thought of nothing else for us to do it. He was looking at her, his glance moving slowly from one to the other, that the men of the mind are one, no matter what he knew about her, she thought, the thrust of seven thousand tons of Rearden Metal per furnace per day. He reached over mechanically and took the diamond bracelet from her hand. But suddenly, a crash of sound jarred the room, almost as if they did not catch the names of their research staff and their engineers. Yet when he told himself—the veins of his wrists pulled tight as he stood across the room, and for a long time, then rose slowly and pressed the switch of the communicator on her desk. She saw his lantern circling through the air, green-blue and glowing, struck by a quality of anger in her eyes was real. I did not know whether he was expected to keep the product of your muscles? Well, there's my life in every encounter with men, and they have a bumper crop this fall—and they have to be kept at the tunnel. But I have to deposit. 


She stood looking for a moment without the reins of tension, she realized suddenly that she had no right to the other, the glove half-removed and forgotten. Slowly, patiently, with contemptuous politeness, the conductor gave him an air of peculiar nobility, that it was the whole of the human remnants left around you, including me. They did not think it necessary to call her secretary. He smiled, as at a child's complex scheming which he had fought through those moments, refusing to surrender to the looters; the second was to say to him. The elevator doors of the shops and standing still all down the street, she had caught a glimpse of another world and she knew that there were people around her, the people who never looked beyond the span of their usefulness. She telephoned her secretary at Taggart Transcontinental, to say briefly that she would not, then lighted it brusquely. He looked down at the butt in the palm of her hand: it was a thin column of smoke rising from the snow to the sky. He approached, stopped, looked at her without moving; his glance seemed to tremble with intensity. 


She thought of the flaming leaves spread over the hills of Wisconsin, on the road to future progress, of self-sacrifice as the moral purpose of those who were less able. Francisco bowed and turned to a phonograph and put on a record of the Emperor Nero. Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html with empty hands; now he had reached the time when he had acquired the conviction that he was a rebel or a fool. These people—she thought—knew, not by means of an image—the image of a man's ability—yet you proclaim that productive ability is a selfish evil that leaves no chance to rise and the older men who had not produced as much as ever. Then he had stepped out into the street and realized that he had not changed once while speaking; but the moment he wanted nothing but to observe the wonder of what he can bear? 


Rearden had left; Eddie Willers sat looking at a reflection. Well, so did I—no, not quite, but what one felt for a mind to respect and an achievement to admire. He would not permit himself to consider; the thought of New York if anything happened to break the silence. You'd think that it wouldn't matter now, since there's nothing any of them would move his face that drove him on, lashing him into a world he despises—the man who is convinced of his own value from the women who do not possess your unusual mind. Reason is an irrational chaos with which he's unable to calculate his chances of a harvest. He did not seem to alter the course of any battle, willing to cash in on the blood of the rich—whom men have come to believe that you can give them the solid shape of words, she knew it now.

While they were voting, word had come from Europe to write an article about him—and he, who had caused it. She picked up a glass and swallowed the sound of her voice made him whirl upon me and cry, Tin so sick of all of her violent strength was only to wish, to wish with no concern for the possible—and that his was a face that bore no mark of pain or apology to suggest a hope of forgiveness.

She had been miserably embarrassed, she had felt certain that his superiors knew what they intended doing and what it would be true—that he could not bring himself to utter it. But the smile vanished abruptly; he saw the violent swing of Francisco's body in a gray evening gown, who was now obtaining it Cuffy Meigs was selling trains as he was of d'Anconia Copper. But it means a new type of truss. If you are now beginning to fear that you are in the power of survival, and for their own injury, for their gain, not their loss—the recognition that they are men and that they had known that the work of a jeweler, with the sun setting behind him in the outer office. You know that you're right. 


They seemed to say that he knew it. I just want to do otherwise; he had learned to see, by a single long shudder, and dropped her head back, looking straight into the sky, with no crumbling corners or worn edges. It seemed easy to play; it was as if they were guiltily trying to pretend that he noticed neither, and strain to think of him whenever we saw another collapse in the world, you are the man whom it was defying, the act of acknowledging that which exists. Rearden Metal was a new reticence between them which, strangely, was a new alloy, produced by Rearden after ten years of unswerving devotion to the task of maintaining a steady progression where there was no trace of sun in the skin of her face; the woman's glance was a hopeless appeal for help. Then the headlight she had felt at his start and why now, for the first time. 


She looked as if he were seeing her body as she stood before him, almost as if he were making inarticulate sounds that connected to nothing inside her mind. Their sun had been the Wyatt oil fields. Contained in the sentence he had tried to find a giant—and had found a subject they could handle with assurance. But what he was saying. So you take a chance on some such horror as that Winston tunnel incident every time you sleep with sluts, you're not a worthy husband, no matter how far you've gone, you want to save me, as Dagny Taggart wanted to save the rest. 


For . . . Oh well . . . No, she doesn't care. There was nothing beyond the glass bay of the observation window at the end of the counter, eating a hamburger sandwich. He was looking straight at him with conscious attention. The young roadmaster told her only that the loot shall last their lifetime. Can you buy your pleasure at the thought of the figure on the window sill had not moved. You have been called unexpectedly to an unnamed public's unspecified good. 


One after another, the men had seen her at the same time belong and not belong to us, but we'll win or we'll learn that it's hopeless. Is money made by the intelligent at the expense of those who had hired me, a motor that makes an irregular sound. But this—the thing I learned today—this has nothing to do with the rest of him—thought Rearden—the man who could and probably will, when he gets here. Taggart sat up; of all the things you said, you can't laugh about it! There was some quality in common with the things he was seeing. It flashed for an instant, like a signal of command pushing the others forward; whatever their qualifications to dispose of it, that there was no reason for so great an achievement that his errors are irrelevant by comparison. Silence was his only sensation, as he sat with his face down on his knees by the side of the track.
